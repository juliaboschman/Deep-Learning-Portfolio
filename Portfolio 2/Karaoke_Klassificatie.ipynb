    "Uit onze EDA zijn een aantal belangrijke punten naar boven gekomen. Zo weten wij dat ieder audio bestand ongeveer 30 seconden lang is. Dat is fijn wanneer wij met de data moeten gaan modelleren, omdat het dan een stuk sneller gaat dan met audio bestanden van 30 seconden. Daarnaast zijn wij er achter gekomen dat er een groot verschil is in de genres wanneer er gekeken wordt naar de lengte van de teksten van een lied. Gemiddeld heeft een hiphop nummer meer tekst van een blues nummer. Deze informatie laat ons geloven dat een model relatief goed kan voorspellen met tekst data als deze de lengte van de teksten mee neemt tijdens het trainen. Verder weten wij nu ook hoe veel genres in de dataset zitten, wat helpt bij het maken van een model. Zo weten wij precies wat de laatste (output) laag van ons model moet zijn. Om de data nog beter voor te bereiden op het trainen zijn er nog een aantal toevoegingen die gedaan kunnen worden om meer duidelijke verschillen te kunnen zien in de data. Deze voegen wij toe in het volgende hoofdstuk waar wij ook uiteindelijk de data gaan trainen en onze eerste voorspellingen gaan maken."

    "Voor het voorspellen van genres van een lied met audio data is het handig om een aantal features toe te voegen aan de data, zodat er meer data gebruikt wordt tijdens het trainen en er betere voorspellingen gedaan kunnen worden. Als eerst hebben wij er voor gekozen om spectorgrams toe te voegen aan onze audio bestanden. Een spectrogram is een visuele representatie van een audiobestand met 3 features. Als eerst heb je op de X-as de tijd van het bestand, op de y-as de frequentie van het audiobestand en de kleur geeft de amplitude aan van de audiobestanden. Deze kleur kan lichtere of donkere tonen aangeven wat dan ook aan geeft of er verschil is in de data. Door het toevoegen van spectrogrammen aan je trainingsdata kunnen er makkelijker patronen herkent worden wat uiteindelijk resulteert in betere voorspellingen (Seeing Sound: What Is A Spectrogram?, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Naast het toevoegen van de spectrogrammen hebben wij er ook voor gekozen om de MFCC's van de audiobestanden toe te voegen aan de data. MFCC staat voor Mel-frequency cepstrum wat slaat op een groep features, vaak tussen de 10 en de 20, die de algemene vorm van de spectrale envelop beschrijven. Wij hebben er voor gekozen om 20 features toe te voegen, zodat er meer data gebruikt kan worden tijdens het trainen. Onze data bevatte eerst namelijk alleen de audiobestanden en de spectrogrammen. De MFCCs worden dan ook afgeleid uit de data van de spectrogrammen. (Deruty, 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "Na creëren van alle functies voor het toevoegen van de nieuwe feautres worden ze gebruikt en hebben we een nieuwe dataset met een hoop nieuwe features dus kunnen helpen bij het correct voorspellen van de genres bij de nummers. Dit doen wij ook voor de uiteindelijke test data, zodat deze gebruikt kan worden om onze prestaties te testen op kaggle.\n",

    "- Sequential: Om een LSTM model te maken beginnen we met het initialiseren van een Sequential model. Wij hebben er voor gekozen om een aantal features toe te voegen aan de data waardoor wij als input shape de shape gebruiken van de \"example_MFCC\" variabele. Hierin is de shape te vinden van de uiteindelijke trainingsdata.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Om een goed model te trainen is het goed om lagen te maken met neuronen met een even getal. Het beste is wanneer het getal van de volgende laag de helft is van de laag ervoor, omdat de data op deze manier het beste leert van de vorige data. Wij hebben er voor gekozen om een model te maken met 3 Bidirectional LSTM lagen. Een normale LSTM laag kijkt alleen naar één laag terug in het verleden terwijl een Bidirectional LSTM laag kijkt naar zowel één laag uit het verleden en één laag in de toekomst. Wij hebben er voor gekozen om deze laag te gebruiken, omdat het meer informatie gebruikt tijdens het trainen wat voor ons voordelig is. \n",
    "    - Lagen: Wij beginnen in de eerste laag met 64 neuronen, in de tweede laag met 32 neuronen en in de derde laag met 16 neuronen. Wij bouwen steeds af in het aantal neuronen zodat het model goed de patronen in de data kan leren. Wij beginnen bij de 64, omdat onze output laag uiteindelijk 8 genres moet kunnen voorspellen, wat weer de helft is van 16, waar we in de derde laag op uit komen. Als laatste hebben we aan deze LSTM lagen ook een regulizer toegevoegd. De regulizer die wij hebben toegevoegd is de L2, die gewichten van features richting de 0 brengt maar wel behoudt, wat goed is voor onze data, omdat wij niet veel data hebben, dus geen informatie willen verliezen. \n",
    "    - Dropout: Tussen elk van de Bidirectional LSTM lagen wordt er een dropout laag toegevoegd. Een dropout van 0.5 houdt in dat er tijdens het trainen 50 procent van de nodes, van die laag, wordt uitgezet en de nodes die uitvallen zijn random gekozen.\n",
    "    - Normalization: Naast het toevoegen van een dropout laag tussen alle Bidirectional LSTM lagen, wordt er ook een Batch Normalisatie toegevoegd tussen iedere laag. Hierin wordt de input data genormaliseerd waardoor het gemiddelde 0 is en de standaarddeviatie 1.\n",
    "    - Ouput laag: Om het model af te sluiten moet er een output laag aangemaakt worden die aangeeft hoeveel mogelijke uitkomsten het model zou moeten kunnen voorspellen. Voor de opdracht moeten wij genres voorspellen wat een totaal heeft van 8 genres. Daarom hebben wij een output laag van 8, met een activatiefunctie \"softmax\". Dit is de activatifunctie die gebruikt wordt wanneer er meerdere categorieën voorspeld moeten worden.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Na het toevoegen van al deze lagen aan het model kan het model getraind worden op onze data, die uiteindelijk gebruikt kan worden op de ongeziene data om de genres te voorspellen."

    "\n",
    "- Loss functie: Voordat we een goede loss functie kunnen kiezen voor ons model is het als aller eerste belangrijk dat er gekeken wordt naar de opdracht. Voor dit portfolio is het de bedoeling om met de hulp van data voorspellingen te maken van een bepaald genre waar een liedje tot toe behoord. Het aantal genres dat wij hebben in onze train dataset is 8. Dat wilt zeggen dat wij bezig zijn met een classificatie taak waar 8 verschillende uitkomsten mogelijk zijn. Daarom kiezen wij er voor om gebruik te maken van de loss functie \"sparse categorical cross entropy\". De reden dat wij niet gewoon categorical cross entropy gebruiken is, omdat deze loss functie alleen one-hot encoded labels accepteert. Wij maken gebruik van simpele integer labels die wel geaccepteerd worden met een sparse categorical cross entropy loss functie. Op deze manier kunnen wij ons model goed trainen met de correcte loss functie.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimizer: De optimizer die wij gebruiken voor ons LSTM audio model is de Adam optimizer. Dit staat voor Adaptive moment estimator en kan goed omgaan met ruis in de data. Ook hebben wij er voor gekozen om deze optimizer te kiezen, omdat hij snel en efficiënt werkt met grote hoeveelheden data. Wij werken voor deze portfolio opdrachten met audio data van 30 seconde, waar features aan zijn toegevoegd. Dit betekent dan ook dat de data groter en groter is geworden en het veel tijd nodig heeft om te trainen. Hierom hebben wij ervoor gekozen om ons model te compileren met de Adam optimizer.\n",
    "    - Werking van de optimizer Adam: Adam houdt tijdens het trainen twee momenten van de gradiënt bij. Ten eerste berekent het, net als de SGD-optimizer, het gemiddelde van de gradiënten. Daarnaast berekent het ook het gemiddelde van de kwadraten van de gradiënten, een extra stap die de SGD-optimizer niet kent. Vervolgens past Adam verschillende leersnelheden toe op elk gewicht, gebaseerd op deze momenten. Bovendien gebruikt Adam informatie over hoe de loss functie verandert ten opzichte van de verschillende parameters van het model om te beslissen welke richting hij moet nemen om de fout te verkleinen. Het past de grootte van de stapjes aan op basis van de grootte van de gradiënt en past ook de richting aan om de meest efficiënte weg naar beneden te vinden. Op deze manier kan Adam snel en slim leren om het model te verbeteren.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Metrics: De uiteindelijke metrics die wij gebruiken om ons model te trainen in de accuracy. De reden dat wij deze metric gebruiken is, omdat wij willen weten hoe goed ons model presteert door te kijken hoe veel van de liedjes een goed voorspellend genre hebben gekregen. "

       " 'A Place\\n\\nSo I have sailed the seas and come…\\n\\nto B…\\na small town fastened to a field in Indiana. Twice there have been twelve hundred people here to answer to the census. The town is outstandingly neat and shady, and always puts its best side to the highway. On one lawn there’s even a wood or plastic iron deer.\\nYou can reach us by crossing a creek. In the spring the lawns are green, the forsythia is singing, and even the railroad that guts the town has straight bright rails which hum when the train is coming, and the train itself has a welcome horning sound.\\nDown the back streets the asphalt crumbles into gravel. There’s Westbrook’s, with the geraniums, Horsefall’s, Mott’s. The sidewalk shatters. Gravel dust rises like breath behind the wagons. And I am in retirement from love.\\n\\nWeather\\n\\nIn the Midwest, around the lower Lakes, the sky in the winter is heavy and close, and it is a rare day, a day to remark on, when the sky lifts and allows the heart up. I am keeping count, and as I write this page, it is eleven days since I have seen the sun.\\n\\nMy House\\n\\nThere’s a row of headless maples behind my house, cut to free the passage of electrical wires. High stumps, ten feet tall, remain, and I climb these like a boy to watch the country sail away from me. They are ordinary fields, a little more uneven than they should be, since in the spring they puddle. The topsoil’s thin, but only moderately stony. Corn is grown one year, soybeans another. At dusk starlings darken the single tree—a larch—which stands in the middle. When the sky moves, fields move under it. I feel, on my perch, that I’ve lost my years. It’s as though I were living at last in my eyes, as I have always dreamed of doing, and I think then I know why I’ve come here: to see, and so to go out against new things—oh god how easily—like air in a breeze. It’s true there are moments—foolish moments, ecstasy on a tree stump—when I’m all but gone, scattered I like to think like seed, for I’m the sort now in the fool’s position of having love left over which I’d like to lose: what good is it now to me, candy ungiven after Halloween?\\n\\nA Person\\n\\nThere are vacant lots on either side of Billy Holsclaw’s house. As the weather improves, they fill with hollyhocks. From spring through fall, Billy collects coal and wood and puts the lumps and pieces in piles near his door, for keeping warn in his one work. I see him most often on mild days sitting on his doorsill in the sun. I notice he’s squinting a little, which is perhaps the reason he doesn’t cackle as I pass. His house is the size of a single garage, and very old. It sheds its paint with its youth, and its boards are a warped and weathered gray. So is Billy. He wears a short lumpy faded black coat when it’s cold, otherwise he always goes about in the same loose, grease-spotted shirt and trousers. I suspect his galluses were yellow once, when they were new.\\n\\nWires\\n\\nThese wires offend me. Three trees were maimed on their account, and now these wires deface the sky. They cross like a fence in front of me, enclosing the crows with the clouds. I can’t reach in, but like a stick, I throw my feelings over. What is it that offends me? I am on my stump, I’ve built a platform there, and the wires prevent my going out. The cut trees, the black wires, all the beyond birds therefore anger me. When I’ve wormed through a fence to reach a meadow, do I ever feel the same about the field?\\n\\nThe Church\\nThe church has a steeple like the hat of a witch, and five birds, all doves, perch in its gutters.\\n\\nMy House\\n\\nLeaves move in the windows. I cannot tell you yet how beautiful it is, what it means. But they do move. They move in the glass.\\n\\nPolitics\\n\\n…for all those not in love.\\nI’ve heard Batista described as a Mason. A farmer who’d seen him in Miami made this claim. He’s as nice a fellow as you’d ever want to meet. Of Castro, of course, no one speaks.\\nFor all those not in love there’s law: to rule…to regulate…to rectify. I cannot write the poetry of such proposals, the poetry of politics, though sometimes—often—always now—I am in that uneasy peach of equal powers which makes a State; then I communicate by passing papers, proclamations, orders, through my bowels. Yet I was not a State with you, nor were we both together any Indiana. A squad of Perching Rifles at the moment, I make myself Right Face! Legislation packs the screw of my intestines. Well, king of the classroom’s king of the hill. You used to waddle when you walked because my sperm between your legs was draining to a towel. Teacher, poet, folded lover—like the politician, like those drunkards, ill, or those who faucet-off while pissing heartily to preach upon the force and fullness of that stream, or pause from vomiting to praise the purity and passion of their puke—I chant, I beg, I orate, I command, I sing—\\n\\nCome back to Indiana—not too late!\\n(or will you be a ranger to the end?)\\nGood-bye…Good-bye…oh, I shall always wait\\nYou, Larry, traveler—\\nstranger,\\nson,\\n—my friend—\\nmy little girl, my poem by heart, my self, my childhood.\\nBut I’ve heard Batista described as a Mason. That dries up my pity, melts my hate. Back from the garage where I have overheard it. I slap the mended fender of my car to laugh, and listen to the metal stinging tartly in my hand.\\n\\nPeople\\n\\nTheir hair in curlers and their heads wrapped in loud scarves, young mothers, fattish in trousers, lounge about in the speedwash, smoking cigarettes, eating candy, drinking pop, thumbing magazines, and screaming at their children above the whir and rumble of the machines.\\nAt the bank  a young man freshly pressed is letting himself in with a key. Along the street, delicately teetering, many grandfathers move in a dream. During the murderous heat of the summer, they perch on window ledges, their feet dangling just inside the narrow shelf of shade the store has made, staring steadily into the street. Where their consciousness has gone I can’t say. It’s not in the eyes. Perhaps it’s diffuse, all temperature and skin, like an infant’s, though more mild. Near the corner there are several large overalled men employed in standing.  A truck turns to be weighed on the scales at the Feed and Grain. Images drift on the drugstore window. The wind has blown the smell of cattle into town. Our eyes have been driven in like the eyes of the old men. And there’s no one to have mercy on us.\\nVital Data\\n\\nThere are two restaurants here and a tearoom, two bars. one bank, three barbers, one with a green shade with which he blinds his windows. two groceries. a dealer in Fords. one drug, one hardware, and one appliance store. several that sell feed, grain, and farm equipment. an antique shop. a poolroom. a laundromat. three doctors. a dentist. a plumber. a vet. a funeral home in elegant repair the color of a buttercup.  numerous beauty parlors that open and shut like night-blooming plants. a tiny dime and department store of no width but several floors. a hutch, homemade, where you can order, after lying down or squirming in, furniture that’s been fashioned from bent lengths of stainless tubing, glowing plastic, metallic thread, and clear shellac. an American Legion Post and a root beer stand. little agencies for this and that: cosmetics, brushes, insurance, greeting cards and garden produce—anything—sample shoes—which do their business out of hats and satchels, over coffee cups and dissolving sugar. a factory for making paper sacks and pasteboard boxes that’s lodged in an old brick building bearing the legend OPERA HOUSE, still faintly golden, on its roof. a library given by Carnegie. a post office. a school. a railroad station. fire station. lumberyard. telephone company. welding shop. garage…and spotted though the town from one end to the other is a line along the highways, gas stations to the number five.\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nIn 1833, Colin Goodykoontz, an itinerant preacher with a name from a fairytale, summed up the situation in one Indiana town this way:\\nIgnorance and her squalid brood. A universal dearth of intellect. Total abstinence \\tfrom literature is very generally practiced…There is not a scholar in grammar or \\tgeography, or a teacher capable of instructing in them, to my knowledge…Others are \\tsupplied a few months of the year with the most antiquated & unreasonable forms \\tof teaching reading, writing & ciphering…Need I stop to remind you of the host of \\tloathsome reptiles such a stagnant pool is fitted to the breed! Croaking jealousy; \\tbloated bigotry; coiling suspicion; warmish blindness; crocodile malice!\\n\\nThings have changed since then, but in none of the respects mentioned.\\n\\nBusiness\\n\\nOne side of the street is blocked off with sawhorses. Hard, thin, butter men in blue jeans, cowboy boots and hats, untruck a dinky carnival. The merchants are promoting themselves. There will be free rides, raucous music, parades and coneys, pop, popcorn, candy, cones, awards and drawings, with all you can endure of pinch, push, bawl, shove, shout, scream, shriek, and bellow. Children pedal past on decorated bicycles, their wheels a blur of color, streaming crinkled paper and excited dogs. A little later there’s a pet shot for a prize—dogs, cats, birds, sheep, ponies, goats—none of which wins. The whirlabouts whirl about. The Ferris wheel climbs dizzily into the sky as far as a tall man on tiptoe might be persuaded to reach, and the irritated operators measure the height and weight of every child with sour eyes to see if they are safe for the machines. An electrical megaphone repeatedly trumpets the names of the generous sponsored. The following day they do not allow the refuse to remain long in the street.\\n\\nMy House, This Place and Body\\n\\nI have met with some mischance, wings withering, as Plato says obscurely, and across the breadth of Ohio, like heaven on a table, I’ve fallen as far as the poet, to the sixth sort of body, this house in B, in Indiana, with its blue and gray bewitching windows, holy magical insides. Great thick evergreens protect its entry. And I live in.\\nLose in the corn rows, I remember feeling just another stalk, and thus this country takes me over in the way I occupy myself when I am well…completely—to the edge of both my house and body. No one notices, when they walk by, that I am brimming in the doorways. My house, this place and body, I’ve come in mourning to be born in. To anybody else it’s pretty silly: love. Why should I feel a loss? How am I bereft? She was never mine; she was a fiction, always a golden tomgirl, barefoot, with an adolescent’s slouch and a boy’s taste for sports and fishing, a figure out of Twain, or worse, in Riley.\\nAge cannot be kind.\\nThere’s little hand-in-hand here…not in B. No one touched except in rage. Occasionally girls will twine their arms about each other and lurch along, school out, toward home and play. I dreamed my lips would drift down your back like a skiff on a river. I’d follow a vein with the point of my finger, hold your bare feet in my naked hands.\\n\\nThe Same Person\\n\\nBilly Holsclaw lives alone—how alone it is impossible to fathom. In the post office he talks greedily to me about the weather. His head bobs on a wild flood of words, and I take this violence to be a measure of his eagerness for speech. He badly needs a shave, coal dust has layered his face, he spits when he speaks, and his fingers pick at his tatters. He wobbles out in the wind when I leave him, a paper sack mashed in the fold of his arms, the leaves blowing past him, and our encounter drives me sadly home to poetry—where there’s no answer. Billy closes his door and carries coal or wood to his fire and closes his eyes, and there’s simply no way of knowing how lonely and empty he is or whether he’s as vacant and barren and loveless as the rest of us are—here in the heart of the country.\\nWeather\\n\\nFor we’re always out of luck here. That’s just how it is—for instance in the winter. The sides of buildings, the roofs, the limbs of the trees are gray. Streets, sidewalks, faces, feelings—they are gray. Speech is gray, and the grass where it shows. Every flank and front, each top is gray. Everything is gray: hair, eyes, window glass, the hawkers’ bills and touters’ posters, lips, teeth, poles and metal signs—they’re gray, quite gray. Cars are gray. Boots, shoes, suits, hats, gloves are gray. Horses, sheep, and cows, cats killed in the road, squirrels in the same way, sparrows, doves, and pigeons, all are gray, everything is gray, and everyone is out of luck who lives here.\\nA similar haze turns the summer sky milky, and the air muffles your head and shoulders like a sweater you’ve got caught in. In the summer light, too, the sky darkens a moment when you open your eyes. The heat is pre distraction. Steeped in out fluids, miserable in the folds of our bodies, we can scarcely think of anything but our sticky parts. Hot cyclonic winds and storms of dust crisscross the country. In many places, given an indifferent push, the wind will still coast for miles, gathering resource and edge as it goes, cunning and force. According to the season, paper, leaves, field litter, seeds, snow, fill up the fences. Sometimes I think the land is flat because the winds have leveled it, they blow so constantly. In any case, a gale can grow in a field of corn that’s as hot as a draft from hell, and to receive it is one of the most dismaying experiences of this life, though the smart of the same wind in winter is more humiliating, and in that sense even worse. But in the spring it rains as well, and the trees fill with ice.\\n\\nPlace\\n\\nMany small Midwestern towns are nothing more than rural slums, and this community could easily become one. Principally during the first decade of the century, though there were many earlier instances, well-to-do farmers moved to town and built fine homes to contain them in their retirement. Others desired a more social life, and so lived in, driving to their fields like storekeepers to their businesses. These houses are now dying like the bereaved who inhabit them; they are slowly losing their senses—deafness, blindness, forgetfulness, mumbling, an insecure gait, an uncontrollable trembling has overcome them. Some kind of Northern Snopes will occupy them next: large-familied, Catholic, Democratic, scrambling, vigorous, poor; and since the parents will work in larger, nearby towns, the children will be loosed upon themselves and upon the hapless neighbors much as the fabulous Khan loosed his legendary horde. These Snopes will undertake makeshift repairs with materials that other people have thrown away; paint halfway round their house, then quit; almost certainly maintain an ugly loud cantankerous dog and underfeed a pair of cats to keep the rodents down. They will collect piles of possibly useful junk in the back yard, park their cars in the front, live largely leaning over engines, give not a hoot for the land, the old community, the hallowed ways, the established clans. Weakening widow ladies have already begun to hire large rude youths from families such as these to rake and mow and tidy the grounds they will inherit.\\n\\nPeople\\n\\nIn the cinders at the station boys sit smoking steadily in darkened cars, their arms bent out the windows, white shirts glowing behind the glass. Nine o’clock is the best time. They sit in a line facing the highway—two or three or four of them—idling their engines. As you walk by a machine may growl at you or a pair of headlights flare up briefly. In a moment one will pull out, spinning cinders behind it, to stalk impatiently up and down the dark streets or roar half a mile into the country before returning to its place in line and pulling up.\\n\\nMy House, My Cat, My Company\\n\\nI must organize myself. I must, as they say, pull myself together, dump this cat from my lap, stir—yes, resolve, move, do. But do what? My will is like the rosy dustlike light in this room: soft, diffuse, and gently comforting. It lets me do…anything…nothing. My ears hear what they happen to: I eat what’s put before me; my eyes see what blunders into them; my thoughts are not thoughts, they are dreams. I’m empty or I’m full…depending: and I cannot choose. I sink my claws in Tick’s fur and scratch the bones of his back until his rear rises amorously. My. Tick, I murmur, I must organize myself. I must pull myself together. And Mr. Tick rolls over on his belly, all ooze.\\nI spill  Mr. Tick when I’ve rubbed his stomach. Shoo. He steps away slowly, his long tail rhyming with his paws. How beautifully he moves, I think; how beautifully, like you, he commands his loving, how beautifully he accepts. So I rise and wander from room to room, up and down, gazing through most of my forty-one windows. How well this house receives its loving too. Let out like Mr. Tick, my eyes sink in the shrubbery. I am not here; I’ve passed the glass, passed second-story spaces, flown by branches, brilliant berries, to the ground, grass high in seed and leafage every season; and it is the same as when I passed above you in my aged, ardent body; it’s, in short, a kind of love; and I am learning to restore myself, my house, my body, by paying court to gardens, cats, and running water, and with neighbors keeping company.\\nMrs. Desmond is my right-hand friend; she’s eighty-five. A thin white mist of hair, fine and tangled, manifests the climate of her mind. She is habitually suspicious, fretful, nervous. Burglars break in at noon. Children trespass. Even now they are shaking the pear tree, stealing rhubarb, denting lawn. Flies caught in the screens and numbed by frost awake in the heat to buzz and scrape the metal cloth and frighten he, through the hollow rooms. It is herself she hears, her own flesh failing, for only death will preserve her from those daily chores she climbs like stairs, and all that anxious waiting. Is it now, she wonders. No? Then: is it now?\\nWe do not converse. She visits me to talk. My task is to murmur. She talks about her grandsons, her daughter who lives in Delphi, her sister or her husband—both gone—obscure friends—dead—obscurer aunts and uncles—lost—ancient neighbors, members of her church or of her clubs—passed or passing on: and in this way she brings the ends of her life together with a terrifying rush: she is a girl, a wife, a mother, widow, all at once. All at once—appalling—but I believe it; I wince in expectation of the clap. Her talk’s a fence—a shade drawn, window fastened, door that’s locked—for no one dies taking tea in a kitchen: and as her years compress and begin to jumble, I really believe in the brevity of live; I sweat in my wonder; death is the dog down the street, the angry gander, bedroom spider, goblin who’s come to her; and it occurs to me that in my listening posture I’m the boy who suffered the winds of my grandfather with an exactly similar politeness, that I am, right now, all my ages, out in elbows, as angular as badly stacked cards. Thus was I, when I loved you, every man I could be, youth and child—far from enough—and you, so strangely ambiguous a being, met me, heart for spade, play after play, the whole run of our suits.\\nMr. Tick, you do me honor. You not only lie in my lap, but you remain alive there, coiled like a fetus. Through your deep nap, I feel you hum. You are, and are not, a machine. You are alive, alive exactly, and it means nothing to you—much to me. You are a cat—you cannot understand—you are a cat so easily. Your nature is not something you much rise to. You, not I, live in: in house, in skin, in shrubbery. Yes. I think I shall hat my head with a steeple; turn church; devour people. Mr. Tick, though, has a tail he can twitch, he need not fly his Fancy. Claws, not metrical schema, poetry his paws; while smoothing…smoothing…smoothing roughly, his tongue laps its neatness. O Mr. Tick, I know you; you are an electrical penis. Go on now, shoo. Mrs. Desmond doesn’t like you. She thinks you will tangle yourself in her legs and she will fall. You murder her birds, she knows, and talking upon her roof with death in your jaws. I must gather myself together for a bound. What age is it I’m at right now, I wonder. The heart, don’t they always say, keeps the true time. Mrs. Desmond is knocking. Faintly, you’d think, but she pounds. She’s brought me a cucumber. I believe she believes I’m a woman. Come in, Mrs. Desmond, thank you, be my company, it looks lovely, and have tea. I’ll slice it, crisp, with cream, for luncheon, each slice as thin as me.\\n\\nPolitics\\n\\nO all ye isolate and separate powers, Sing! Sing, and sing in such a way that from a distance it will seem a harmony, a Strindberg play, a friendship ring…so happy—happy, happy, happy—as here we go hand in handling, up and down. Our union was a singing, though we were silent in the songs we sang like single notes are silent in a symphony. In no sense sober, be barbershopped together and never heard the discords in our music or saw ourselves as dirty, cheap, or silly. Yet cats have worn out better shoes than those thrown through our love songs at us. Hush.  Be patient—prudent—politic. Still, Cleveland killed you, Mr. Crane. Were you not politic enough and fond of being beaten? Like a piece of sewage, the city shat you from its stern three hundred miles from history—beyond the loving reach of sailors. Well, I’m not a poet who puts Paris to his temple in his youth to blow himself from Idaho, or—fancy that—Missouri. My god, I said, this is my country, but must my country go so far as Terre Haute or Whiting, go so far as Gary?\\nWhen the Russians first announced the launching of their satellite, many people naturally refused to believe them. Later others were outraged that they had sent a dog around the earth. I wouldn’t want to take that mutt from our that metal flying thing if he’s still living when he lands, our own dog catcher said; anybody knows you shut a dog up by himself to toss around the first thing he’ll be setting on to do you let him out is bite somebody.\\nThis Midwest. A dissonance of parts and people, we are a consonance of Towns. Like a man grown fat in everything but heart, we overlabor; our outlook never really urban, never rural either, we enlarge and linger at the same time, as Alice both changed and remained in her story. You are blond. I put my hands upon your belly; feel it tremble from my trembling. We always drive large cars in my section of the country. How could you be a comfort to me now?\\n\\nMore Vital Data\\n\\nThe town is exactly fifty houses, trailers, stores, and miscellaneous buildings long, but in places no streets deep. It takes on width as you drive south, always adding to the east. Most of the dwellings are fairly spacious farm houses in the customary white, with wide wraparound porches and tall narrow windows, though there are many of the grander kind—fretted, scalloped, turreted, and decorated with clapboards set at angles or on end, with stained-glass windows at the stair landings and lots of wrought iron full of fancy curls—and a few of these look like castles in their rarer brick. Old stables serve as garages now, and the lots are large to contain them and the vegetable and flower gardens which, ultimately, widows plant and weed and then entirely disappear in. The shade is ample, the grass is good, the sky a glorious fall violet; the apple trees are heavy and red, the roads are calm and empty; corn has sifted from the chains of tractored wagons to speckle the streets with gold and with the russet fragments of the cob, and a man would be a fool who wanted, blessed with this, to live anywhere else in the world.\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nBuses like great orange animals move through the early light to school. There the children will be taught to read and warned against Communism By Miss Janet Jakes. That’s not her name. Her name is Helen something—Scott or James. A teacher twenty years. She’s now worn fine and smooth, and has a face, Wilfred says, like a mail-order ax. Her voice is hoarse, and she has a cough. For she screams abuse. The children stare, their faces blank. This is the thirteenth week. They are used to it. You will all, she shouts, you will all draw pictures of me. No. She is a Mrs.—someone’s missus. And in silence they set to work while Miss Jakes jabs hairpins in her hair. Wilfred says an ax, but she has those rimless tinted glasses, graying hair, an almost dimpled chin. I must concentrate. I must stop making up things. I must give myself to live; let it mold me: that’s what they say in Wisdom’s Monthly Digest every day. Enough, enough—you’ve been at it long enough; and the children rise formally a row at a time to present their work to her desk. No, she wears rims; it’s her chin that’s dimple-less. Well, it will take more than a tablespoon for features to sweeten that face. So she grimly shuffles their sheets, examines her reflection crayoned on them. I would not dare…allow a child…to put a line around me. Though now and then she smiles like a nick in the blade, in the end these drawings depress her. I could not bear it—how can she ask?—that anyone…draw me. Her anger’s lit. That’ why she does it: flame. There go her eyes; the pink in her glasses brightens, dims. She is a pumpkin, and her rage is breathing like the candle in. No, she shouts, no—the cartoon trembling—no, John Mauck, John Stewart Mauck, this will not do. The picture flutters from her fingers. You’ve made me too muscular.\\nI work on my poetry. I remember my friends, associates, my students, by their names. Their names are Maypop, Dormouse, Upsydaisy. Their names are Gladiolus, Callow Bladder, Prince and Princess Oleo, Hieronymus, Cardinal Mummum, Mr. Fitchew, The Silken Howdah, Spot. Sometimes you’re Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn; it is perpetually summer; your buttocks are my pillow; we are adrift on a raft; your back is our river. Sometimes you are Major Barbara, sometimes a goddess who kills men in battle, sometimes you are soft like a shower of water; you are bread in my mouth.\\nI do not work on my poetry. I forget my friends, associates, my students, and their names: Gramophone, Blowgun, Pickle, Serenade…Marge the now in B, in Indiana: out of job and out of patience, out of love and time and money, out of bread and out of body, in a temper, Mrs. Desmond, out of tea. So shut your fist up, bitch, you bag of death; go bang another door; go die, my dearie. Die, life-deaf old lady. Spill your breath. Fall over like a frozen board. Gray hair grows from the nose of your mind. You are a skull already—memento mori—the foreskin retracts from your teeth. Will your plastic gums last longer than your bones, and color their grinning? And is………bitch. I wanted to be famous, but you bring me age—my emptiness. Was is that which I thought would balloon me above the rest? Love? where are you?...love me. I want to rise so high, I said, that when I shit I won’t miss anybody.\\n\\nBusiness\\n\\nFor most people, business is poor. Nearby cities have siphoned off all but a neighborhood trade. Except for feed and grain and farm supplies, you stand a chance to sell only what one runs out to buy. Chevrolet has quit, and Frigidaire. A locker plant has left its afterimage. The lumberyard has been, so far, six months about its going. Gas stations change hands clumsily, a restaurant becomes available, a grocery closes. One day they came and knocked the cornices from the watch repair and pasted campaign posters on the windows. Torn across, by now, by boys, they urge you still to vote for half an orange beblazoned man who as a while one failed two years ago to win at his election. Everywhere, in this manner, the past speaks, and it mostly speaks of failure. The empty stores, the old signs and dusty fixtures, the debris in alleys, the flaking paint and rusty gutters, the heavy locks and sagging boards: they say the same disagreeable things. What do the sightless windows see, I wonder, when the sun throws a passerby against them? Here a stair unfolds toward the street—dark, rickety, and treacherous—and I always feel, ad I pass it, that if I just went carefully up and turned the corner at the landing, I would find myself out of the world. But I’ve never had the courage.\\n\\nThat Same Person\\n\\nThe weeds catch up with Billy. In pursuit of the hollyhocks, they rise in coarse clumps all around the front of his house. Billy has to stamp down a circle by his door like a dog or cat does turning round to nest up, they’re so thick. What particularly troubles me is that winter will find the weeds still standing stiff and tindery to take the sparks which Billy’s little mortarless chimney spouts. It’s true that fires are fun here. The town whistle, which otherwise only blows for noon (and there’s no noon on Sunday), signals the direction of the fire by the length and number of its blasts, the volunteer firemen rush past in their cars and trucks, houses empty their owners along the street every time like an illustration in a children’s book. There are many bikes, too, and barking dogs, and sometimes—halleluiah—the fire’s right here in town—a vacant lot of weeds and stubble flaming up. But I’d rather it weren’t Billy or Billy’s lot or house. Quite selfishly I want him to remain the way he is—counting his sticks and logs, sitting on his sill in the soft early sun—though I’m not sure what his presence means to me…or to anyone. Nevertheless, I keep wondering whether, given time, I might not someday find a figure in out language which would serve him faithfully, and furnish his poverty and loneliness richly out.\\n\\nWires\\n\\nWhere sparrows sit like fists. Doves fly the steeple. In mist the wires change perspective, rise and twist. If they led to you, I would know what they were. Thoughts passing often, like the starlings who flock these fields at evening to sleep in the trees beyond, would form a family of paths like this; they’d foot down the natural height of air to just about a bird’s perch. But they do not lead to you.\\n\\nOf whose beauty it was sung.\\nShe shall make the old man young.\\n\\nThey fasten me.\\nIf I walked straight on, in my present mood, I would reach the Wabash. It’s not a mood in which I’d choose to conjure you. Similes dangle like baubles from me. This time of year the river is slow and shallow, the clay banks crack in the sun, weeds surprise the sandbars. The air is moist and I am sweating. It’s impossible to rhyme in this dust. Everything—sky, the cornfield, stump, wild daisies, my old clothes and pressless feelings—seem fabricated for installment purchase. Yes. Christ. I am suffering a summer Christmas; and I cannot walk under the wires. The sparrows scatter like handfuls of gravel. Really, wires are voices in thin stripes. They are words wound in cables. Bars of connection.\\n\\nWeather\\n\\nI would rather it were the weather that was to blame for what I am and what my friends and neighbors are—we who live here in the heart of the country. Better the weather, the wind, the pale dying snow…the snow—why not the snow? There’s never much really, not around the lover Lakes anyway, not enough to boast about, not enough to be useful. My father tells how the snow in the Dakotas would sweep to the roofs of the barns in the old days, and he and his friends would sled on the crust that would form because the snow was so fiercely driven. In Bemidji trees have been known to explode. That would be something—if the trees in Davenport or Francisville or Carbondale or Niles were to do blam some winter—blam! blam! blam! All the way down the gray, cindery, snow-sick streets.\\nA cold fall rain is blackening the trees or the air if like lilac and full of parachuting seeds. Who cares to live in any season but his own? Still I suspect the secret’s in this snow, the secret of our sickness, if we could only diagnose it, for we are all dying like the elms of Urbana. This snow—like our skin it covers the country. Later dust will do it. Right now—snow. Mud presently. But it is snow without any laughter in it, a pale gray pudding thinly spread on stiff toast, and if that seems a strange description, it’s accurate all the same. Of course soot blackens everything, but apart from that, we are never sufficiently cold here. The flakes as they come, alive and burning, we cannot retain, for if our temperatures fall, they rise promptly again, just as, in the summer, they bob about in the same feckless way. Suppose though…suppose they were to rise some August, climb and rise, and then hang in the hundreds like a hawk through December, what a desert we could make of ourselves—from Chicago to Cairo, from Hammond to Columbus—what beautiful Death Valleys.\\n\\nPlace\\n\\nI would rather it were the weather. It drives us in upon ourselves—an unlucky fate. Of course there is enough to stir our wonder anywhere; there’s enough to love, anywhere, if one is strong enough, if one is diligent enough, if one is perceptive, patient, kind enough—whatever it takes; and surely it’s better to live in the country, to live on a prairie by a drawing of rivers, in Iowa or Illinois or Indiana, say, than in any city, in any stinking fog of human beings, in any blooming orchard of machines. It ought to be. The cities are swollen and poisonous with people. It ought to be better. Man has never been a fit environment for man—for rats, maybe, rats do nicely, or for dogs or cats and the household beetle.\\nAnd how long the street is, nowadays. These endless walls are fallen to keep back the tides of earth. Brick could be beautiful but we have covered it gradually with gray industrial vomits. Age does not make concrete genial, and asphalt is always—like America—twenty-one, until it breaks up in crumbs like stale cake. The brick, the asphalt, the concrete, the dancing signs and garish posters, the feed and excrement of the automobile, the litter of its inhabitants, they compose, they decorate, they line our streets, and there is nowhere, nowadays, our streets can’t reach.\\nA man in the city has no natural thin by which to measure himself. His parks are plotted plants. Nothing can live and remain free where he resides but the pigeon, starling, sparrow, spider, cockroach, mouse, moth, fly, and weed, and he laments the existence of even these and makes his plans to poison them. The zoo? There is the zoo. Through its bard the city man stares at the great cats and dully sucks his ice. Living, alas, among men and their marvels, the city man supposes that his happiness depends on establishing somehow, a special kind of harmonious accord with others. The novelists of the city, of slums and crowds, they call it love—and break their pens.\\nWordsworth feared the accumulation of men in cities. He foresaw their “degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation,” and some of their hunger for love. Living in a city, among so many, dwelling in the heat and tumult of incessant movement, a man’s affairs are touch and go—that’s all. It’s not surprising that the novelists of the slums, the cities, and the crowds, should find that sex is but a scratch to ease a tickle, that we’re most human when we’re sitting on the john, and that the justest image of our life is in full passage through the plumbing\\n\\nThat man, immur’d in cities, still retains\\nHis inborn inextinguishable thirst\\nOf rural scenes, compensating his loss\\nBy supplemental shifts, the best he may.\\n\\nCome into the country, then. The air numbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses. Here, growling tractors tear the earth. Dust rolls up behind them. Drivers sit jouncing under bright umbrellas. They wear refrigerated hats and steer by looking at the tracks they’ve cut behind them, their transistors blaring. Close to the land, are they? good companions  to the soil? Tell me: do they live in harmony with the alternating seasons?\\nIt’s a life of old poetry. The modern husbandman uses chemicals from cylinders and sacks, spike-ball-and-claw machines, metal sheds, and cost accounting. Nature in the old sense does not matter. It does not exist. Our farmer’s only mystical attachment is to parity. And id he does not realize that cows and corn are simply different kinds of chemical engine, he cannot expect to make a go of it.\\nIt isn’t necessary to suppose our cows have feelings; our neighbor haven’t as many as he used to have either; but think of it this way a moment, you can correct for the human imputations later: how would it feel to nurse those strange tentacled calves with their rubber, glass, and metal lips, their stainless eyes?\\n\\nPeople\\n\\nAunt Pet’s still able to drive her car—a high square Ford—even though she walks with difficulty and a stout stick. She has a watery gaze, a smooth plump face despite her age, and jet black hair in a bun. She has the slowest smile of anyone I ever saw, but she hates dogs, and not very long ago cracked the back of one she cornered in her garden. To prove her vigor she will tell you this, her smile breaking gently while she raises the knob of her stick to the level of your eyes.\\n\\nHouse, My Breath and Window\\n\\nMy window is a grave, and all that lies within it’s dead. No snow is falling. There’s no haze. It is not still, not silent. Its images are not an animal that waits, for movement is no demonstration. I have seen the sea slack, life bubble through a body without a trace, its spheres impervious as soda’s. Downwound, the whore at wagtag clicks and clacks. Leaves wiggle. Grass sways. A bird chirps, pecks the ground. An auto wheel in penning circles keeps its rigid spokes. These images are stones; they are memorials. Beneath this sea lies sea: god rest it…rest the world beyond my window, me in front of my reflection, above this page, my shade. Death is not so still, so silent, since silence implies a falling quiet, stillness a stopping, containing, holding in: for death is time in a clock, like Mr. Tick, electric…like wind through a windup poet. And my blear floats out to visible against the glass, befog its country and bespill myself. The mist lifts slowly from the fields in the morning. No one noe would say: the Earth throws back its covers; it is rising from sleep. Why is the feeling foolish? The image is too Greek. I used to gaze at you so wantonly your body blushed. Imagine: wonder: that my eyes could cause such flowering. Ah, my friend, your face is pale, the weather cloudy; a street has been felled through your chin, bare trees do nothing, houses take root in their rectangles, a steeple stands up in your head. You speak of loving; then give me a kiss. The pane is cold. On icy mornings the fog rises to greet me (as you always did); the barns and other buildings, rather than ghostly, seem all the more substantial for looming, as if they grew in themselves while I watched (as you always did). Oh my approach, I suppose, was like breath in a rubber monkey. Nevertheless, on the road along the Wabash in the morning, through the trees are sometimes obscured by fog, their reflection floats serenely on the river, reasoning the banks, the sycamores in French rows. Magically, the world tips. I\\'m led to think that only those who grow down live (which will scarcely win me twenty-five from Wisdom\\'s Monthly Digest), but I find I write that only those who live down grow; and what I write, I hold, whatever I really know. My every word\\'s inverted, or reversed- or I am. I held you, too, that way. You were so utterly provisional, subject to my change. I could inflate your bosom with a kiss, disperse your skin with gentleness, enter your vagina from within, and make my love emerge like a fresh sex. The pane is cold. Honesty is cold, my inside lover. The sun looks, through the mist, like a plum on the tree of heaven, or a bruise on the slope of your belly. Which? The grass crawls with frost. We meet on this window, the world and I, inelegantly, swimmers of the glass; and swung wrong way round to one another, the world seems in. The world- how grand, how monumental, grave and deadly, that word is: the world, my house, and poetry. All poets have their inside lovers. Wee penis does not belong to me, or any of this foggery. It is his property which he\\'s thrust through what\\'s womanly of me to set down this. These wooden houses in their squares, gray streets, and fallen sidewalks, standing trees, your name I\\'ve written sentimentally across my breath into the whitening air, pale birds: they exist in me now because of him. I gazed with what intensity... A bush in the excitement of its roses could not have bloomed so beautifully as you did then. It was a look I\\'d like to give this page. For that is poetry: to bring within about, to change.\\n\\nPolitics\\n\\nSports, politics, and religion are the three passions of the badly educated. They are the Midwest\\'s open sores. Ugly to see, a source of constant discontent, they sap the body\\'s strength. Appalling quantities of money, time, and energy are wasted on them. The rural mind is narrow, passionate, and reckless on those matters. Greed, however shortsighted and direct, will not alone account for it. I have known men, for instance, who for years have voted squarely against their interests. Nor have I ever noticed that their surly Christian views prevented them from urging forward the smithereening, say, of Russia, China, Cuba, or Korea. And they tend to back their country like they back their local team: they have a fanatical desire to win; yelling is their forte; and if things go badly, they are inclined to sack the coach. All in all, Birch is a good name. It stands for the bigot\\'s stick, the wild-child-tamer\\'s cane.\\nForgetfulness- is that their object?\\nOh, I was new, I thought. A fresh start: new cunt, new climate, and new country- there you were, and I was pioneer, and had no history. That language hurts me, too, my dear.

Imagine the landscape of that face: no crayon could engender it; soft wax is wrong; thin wire in trifling snips might do the trick. Paula Frosty and Christopher Roger accuse the pale and splotchy Cheryl Pipes. But Miss Jakes, I saw her. Miss Jakes is so extremely vexed she snaps her pencil. What else is missing? I appoint you a detective, John: search her desk. Gum, candy, paper, pencils, marble, round eraser--whose? A thief. I can\\'t watch her all the time, I\\'m here to teach. Poor pale fossetted Cheryl, it\\'s determined, can\\'t return the money because she took it home and spent it.

Now Cheryl, she says, this won\\'t be taken off until you bring that money out of home, out of home straight up to here, Miss Jake says, tapping her desk.\\nWhich is three days.\\n\\nAnother Person\\n\\nI was raking leaves when Uncle Halley introduced himself to me. He said his name came from the comet, and that his mother had borne him prematurely in her fright of it. I thought of Hobbes, whom fear of the Spanish Armada had hurried into birth, and so I believed Uncle Halley to honor the philosopher, though Uncle Halley is a liar, and neither the one hundred twenty-nine nor the fifty-three he ought to be. That fall the leaves had burned themselves out on the trees, the leaf lobes had curled, and now they flocked noisily down the street and were broken in the wires of my rake. Uncle Halley was himself (like Mrs. Desmond and history generally) both deaf and implacable, and he shooed me down his basement stairs to a room set aside there for stacks of newspapers reaching to the ceiling, boxes of leaflets and letters and programs, racks of photo albums, scrapbooks, bundles of rolled-up posters and maps, flags and pennants and slanting piles of dusty magazines devoted mostly to monitoring and the Christian ethic. I saw a bird cage, a tray of butterflies, a bugle, a stiff straw boater, and all kinds of tassels tied to a coat tree. He still possessed and had on display the steering lever from his first car, a linen duster, driving gloves and goggles, photographs along the wall of himself, his friends, and his various machines, a shell from the first war, a record of \"Ramona\" nailed through its hole to a post, walking sticks and fanciful umbrellas, shoes of all sorts (his baby shoes, their counters broken, were held in sorrow beneath my nose--they had not been bronzed, but he might have them done someday before he died, he said), countless boxes of medals, pins, beads, trinkets, toys, and keys (I scarcely saw--they flowed like jewels from his palms), pictures of downtown when it was only a path by the railroad station, a brightly colored globe of the world with a dent in Poland, antique guns, belt buckles, buttons, souvenir plates and cups and saucers (I can\\'t remember all of it--i Won\\'t), but I recall hoe shamefully, how rudely, how abruptly, I fled, a good story in my mouth but death in my nostrils; and hoe afterward I busily, righteously, burned my leaves as if I were purging the world of its years. I still wonder if this town--its life, and mine now--isn\\'t really a record like the one of \"Ramona\" that I used to crank around on my grandmother\\'s mahogany Victrola through lonely rainy days as a kid.\\n\\nThe First Person\\n\\nBilly\\'s like the coal he\\'s found: spilled, mislaid, discarded. The sky\\'s no comfort. His house and his body are dying together. His windows are boarded. And now he\\'s reduced to his hands. I suspect he has glaucoma. At any rate he can scarcely see, and weeds his yard of rubble on his hands and knees. Perhaps he\\'s a surgeon cleansing a wound or an ardent and tactile lover. I watch, I must say, apprehensively. Like mine-war detectors, his hands graze in circles ahead of him. Your nipples were the color of your eyes. Pebble. Snarl of paper. Length of twine. He leans down closely, picks up something silvery, holds it hear his nose. Foil? cap? coin? He has within him--what, I wonder? Does he know more now because he fingers everything and has to sniff to see? It would be romantic cruelty to think so. He bends the down on your arms like a breeze. You wrote me; something is strange when we don\\'t understand. I write in return: I think when I loved you I fell to my death.\\nBilly, I could read to you from Beddoes; he\\'s your man perhaps; he held with dying, freed his blood of its arteries; and he said that there were many wretched love-ill fools like me lying alongside the last bone of their former selves, as full of spirit and speech, nonetheless, as Mrs. Desmond, Uncle Halley and the Ferris wheel, Aunt Pet, Miss Jakes, Ramona or the megaphone; yet i reverse him finally, Billy, on no evidence but braggadocio, and I declare that though my inner organs were devoured long ago, the worm which swallowed down my parts still throbs and glows like a crystal palace.\\nYes, you were younger. I was Uncle Halley, the museum man and infrequent meteor. Here is my first piece of ass. They weren\\'t so flat in those days, had more round, more juice. And over here\\'s the sperm I\\'ve spilled, nicely jarred and clearly labeled. Look at this tape like lengths of intestine where i\\'ve stored my spew, the endless worm of words I\\'ve written, a hundred million emissions or more: oh I was quite a man right from the start; even when unconscious in my cradle, from crotch to cranium, I was erectile tissue; though mostly, after the manner approved by Plato, I had intercourse by eye. Never mind, old Holsclaw, you are blind. We pull down darkness when we go to bed; put out like Oedipus the actually offending organ, and train our touch to lies. All cats are gray, says Mr. Tick; so under cover of glaucoma you are a sack gray too, and cannot be distinguished from a stallion.\\nI must pull myself together, get a grip, just as they say, but I feel spilled, bewildered, quite mislaid. I did not restore my house to its youth, but to its age. Hunting, you hitch through the hollyhocks. I\\'m inclined to say you aren\\'t half the cripple I am, for there is nothing left of me but mouth. However, i resist the impulse, It is another lie of poetry. My organs are all there, though it\\'s there where I fail--at the roots of my experience. Poetry, like love, is--in and out--a physical caress. I can\\'t tolerate any more of my sophistries about spirit, mind, and breath. Body equals being, and if your weight goes down, you are the less.\\n\\nHousehold Apples\\n\\nI knew nothing about apples. Why should I? My country came in my childhood, and I dreamed of sitting among the blooms like the bees. I failed to spray the pear tree too. I doubled up under them at first, admiring the sturdy low branches I should have pruned, and later I acclaimed the blossoms. Shortly after the fruit formed there were falls--not many--apples the size of goodish stones which made me wobble on my ankles when I walked about the yard. Sometimes a piece crushed by a heel would cling on the shoe to track the house. I gathered a few and heaved them over the wires. A slingshot would have been splendid. Hard, an unattractive green, the worms had them. Before long I realized the worms had them all. Even as the apples reddened, lit their tree, they were being swallowed. The birds preferred the pears, which were small--sugar pears I think they\\'re called--with thick skins of graying green that ripen on toward violet. So the fruit fell, and once I made some applesauce by quartering and paring hundreds; but mostly I did nothing, left them, until suddenly, overnight it seemed, in that ugly late September heat we often have in Indiana, my problem was upon me.\\nMy childhood came in the country. I remember, now, the flies on our snowy luncheon table. As we cleared away they would settle, fastidiously scrub themselves and stroll to the crumbs to feed where I would kill them in crowds with a swatter. It was quite a game to catch them taking off. I struck heavily since I didn\\'t mind a few stains; they\\'d wash. The swatter was a square of screen bound down in red cloth. It drove no air ahead of it to give them warning. The faint pink dot where they had died did not rub out as I\\'d supposed, and after years of use our luncheon linen would faintly, pinkly, speckle.\\nThe country became my childhood. Flies braided themselves on the flypaper in my grandmother\\'s house. I can smell the bakery and the grocery and the stables and the dairy in that small Dakota town I knew as a kid; knew as I dreamed I\\'d know your body, as I\\'ve known nothing, before or since; knew as the flies knew, in the honest, unchaste sense: the burned house, hose-wet, which drew a mist of insects like the blue smoke of its smolder, and gangs of boys, moist-lipped, destructive as its burning. Flies have always impressed me; they are so persistently alive. Now they were coating the ground beneath my trees. Some were ordinary flies; there were the large blue-green ones; there were swarms of fruit flies too, and the red-spotted scavenger beetle; there were a few wasps, several sorts of bees and butterflies—checkers, sulphurs, monarchs, commas, question marks—and delicate dragonflies…but principally houseflies and horseflies and bottleflies, flies and more flies in clusters around the rotting fruit. They loved the pears. Inside, they fed. If you picked up a pear, they flew, and the pear became skin and stem. They were everywhere the fruit was: in the tree still—apples like a hive for them—or where the fruit littered the ground, squashing itself as you stepped…there was no help for it. The flies droned, feasting on the sweet juice. No one could go near the trees; I could not climb; so I determined at last to labor like Hercules. There were fruit baskets in the barn. Collecting them and kneeling under the branches, I began to gather remains. Deep in the strong rich smell of the fruit, I began to hum myself. The fruit caved in at the touch. Glistening red apples, my lifting disclosed, had families of beetles, flies, and bugs, devouring their rotten undersides. There were streams of flies; there were lakes and cataracts and rivers of flies, seas and oceans. The hum was heavier, higher, than the hum of the bees when they came to the blooms in the spring, though the bees were there, among the flies, ignoring me—ignoring everyone. As my work went on and juice covered my hands and arms, they would form a sleeve, black and moving, like knotty wool. No caress could have been more indifferently complete. Still I rose fearfully, ramming my head in the branches, apples bumping against me before falling, bursting with bugs. I’d snap my hand sharply but the flies would cling to the sweet. I could toss a whole cluster into a basket from several feet. As the pear or apple lit, they would explosively rise, like monads for a moment, windowless, certainly, with respect to one another, sugar their harmony. I had to admit, though, despite my distaste, that my arm had never been more alive, oftener or more gently kissed. Those hundreds of feet were light. In washing them off, I pretended the hose was a pump. What have I missed? Childhood is a lie of poetry.\\n\\nThe Church\\n\\nFriday night. Girls in dark skirts and white blouses sit in tanks and scream in concert. They carry funnels loosely stuffed with orange and black paper which they shake wildly, and small megaphones through which, as drilled, they direct and magnify their shouting. Their leaders, barely pubescent girls, prance and shake and whirl their skirts above their bloomers. The young men, leaping, extend their arms and rave through the puddles of amber light, their bodies glistening. In a lull, though it rarely occurs, you can hear the squeak of tennis shoes against the floor. Then the yelling begins again, and then continues; fathers, mothers, neighbors joining in to form a single pulsing ululation—a cry of the whole community—for in this gymnasium each body becomes the bodies beside it, pressed as they are together, thigh to thigh, and the same shudder runs through all of them, and runs toward the same release. Only the ball moves serenely through this dazzling din. Obedient to law it scarcely speaks but caroms quietly and lives at peace.\\n\\nBusiness\\n\\nIt is the week of Christmas and the stores, to accommodate the rush they hope for, are remaining open in the evening. You can see the show falling in the cones of the street lamps. The roads are filling—undisturbed. Stings of red and green lights droop over the principal highway, and the water tower wears a star. The windows of the stores have been bedizened. Shamelessly they beckon. But I am alone, leaning against a pole—no…there is no one in sight. They’re all at home, perhaps by their instruments, tuning in on their evenings, and like Ramona, tirelessly playing and replaying themselves. There’s a speaker perched in the tower, and through the boughs of falling snow and over the vacant streets, it drapes the twisted and metallic strains of a tune that can barely be distinguished—yes, I believe it’s one of the jolly ones, it’s “Joy to the World.” There’s no one to hear the music but myself, and though I’m listening, I’m no longer certain. Perhaps the record’s playing something else.1Embed',\n",

coming home late one dark afternoon\\nReporter stopped me for a interview\\nShe said she\\'s heard stories and she\\'s heard fables\\nThat I\\'m vicious on the mic and the turntables\\nThis young reporter, I did adore\\nSo I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before\\nShe said, \"Damn, fly guy, I\\'m in love with you\\nThe Casanova legend must have been true\"\\nI said, \"By the way, baby, what\\'s your name?\"\\nSaid \"I go by the name Lois Lane\"\\nAnd you could be my boyfriend, you surely can\\nJust let me quit my boyfriend called Superman\\nI said, \"He\\'s a fairy, I do suppose\\nFlying through the air in pantyhose\\nHe may be very sexy or even cute\\nBut he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit\"\\nI said, \"You need a man who\\'s got finesse\\nAnd his whole name across his chest\\nHe may be able to fly all through the night\\nBut can he rock a party \\'til the early light?\\nHe can\\'t satisfy you with his little worm\\nBut I can bust you out with my super sperm\"\\nI go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it\\nAn\\' I\\'m here and I\\'m there, I\\'m Big Bank Hank, I\\'m everywhere\\nA just throw your hands up in the air\\nAnd party hardy

friend\\n\\n[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\\nI say skip, dive, what can I say?\\nI can\\'t fit \\'em all inside my OJ\\nSo I just take half and bust them out\\nI give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house\\n\\n[Verse 7: Master Gee]\\nIt was twelve o\\'clock a one Friday night\\nI was rocking to the beat and feeling alright\\nEverybody was dancing on the floor\\nDoing all the things they never did before\\nAnd then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean\\nShe came into the bar, she came into the scene\\nAs she traveled deeper inside the room\\nAll the fellas checked out her white Sassoons\\nShe came up to the table, looked into my eyes\\nThen she turned around and shook her behind\\nSo I said to myself, its time for me to release\\nMy vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece\\nAnd now people in the house, this is just for you\\nA little rap to make you boogaloo\\nNow, the group ya hear is called Phase 2\\nAnd let me tell ya something we\\'re a hell of a crew\\nOnce a week we\\'re on the street\\nJust a cutting the jams and making it freak\\nFor you to party, got to have the moves\\nSo we\\'ll get right down and give you a groove\\nFor you to dance you got to be hype\\nSo we\\'ll get right down and make ya rock\\nNow the system\\'s on and the girls are there\\nYou definitely have a rocking affair\\nBut let me tell ya something, there\\'s still one fact\\nThat to have a party, got to have a rap\\nSo when the party\\'s over you\\'re making it home\\nAnd trying to sleep before the break of dawn\\nAnd while ya sleeping, you start to dream\\nAnd thinking how ya danced on the disco scene\\nA name appears in your mind\\nYeah, a name you know that was right on time\\nIt was Phase 2 a just a doing the do\\nRocking ya down \\'cause ya know we could\\nTo the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak\\nA come alive, girls, a get on your feet\\nTo the rhythm of the beat, to the beat, the beat\\nTo the double beat-beat that it makes ya freak\\nTo the rhythm of the beat that says you go on\\nOn and on until the break of dawn\\nNow I got a man coming on right now\\nHe\\'s guaranteed to throw down\\nHe goes by the name of Wonder Mike\\nA come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like\\n\\n[Verse 8: Wonder Mike]\\nI say, a can of beer that\\'s sweeter than honey\\nLike a millionaire that has no money\\nLike a rainy day that is not wet\\nLike a gambling fiend that does not bet\\nLike Dracula without his fangs\\nLike the boogie to the boogie without the boogie-bang\\nLike collard greens that don\\'t taste good\\nLike a tree that\\'s not made out of wood\\nLike going up and not coming down\\nIs just like the beat without the sound, no sound\\nTo the beat, beat, ya do the freak\\nEverybody just rock and dance to the beat\\nHave you ever went over a friend\\'s house to eat\\nAnd the food just ain\\'t no good?\\nI mean the macaroni\\'s soggy, the peas are mushed\\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\\nA so you try to play it off like you think you can\\nBy saying that you\\'re full\\nAnd then your friend says, \"Mama, he\\'s just being polite\\nHe ain\\'t finished, uh-uh, that\\'s bull\"\\nA so your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie\\nAnd you say that you already ate\\nAnd your friend says, \"Man, there\\'s plenty of food\"\\nSo you pile some more on your plate\\nBut while the stinky food\\'s steaming, your mind starts to dreaming\\nOf the moment that it\\'s time to leave\\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken\\'s slowly rotting\\nInto something that looks like cheese\\nOh, so you say that\\'s it, I got to leave this place\\nI don\\'t care what these people think\\nI\\'m just sitting here making myself nauseous\\nWith this ugly food that stinks\\nOh, so you bust out the door while it\\'s still closed\\nStill sick from the food you ate\\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\\nFrom a bottle of Kaopectate\\nAnd then you call your friend a two weeks later\\nTo see how he has been\\nAnd he says \"I understand about the food\\nBaby bubba, but we\\'re still friends\"\\n\\n[Chorus: Wonder Mike]\\nA with a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie\\nThe hip, hip-hop and you don\\'t stop the rockin\\'\\nTo the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie\\nTo the rhythm of the boogie, the beat\\n\\n[Post-Chorus: Wonder Mike]\\nI said, \"A Hank, a can ya rock?\\nCan ya rock to the rhythm that just don\\'t stop?\\nA can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?\"\\nI said, \"A come on, make, m-make the people move\"\\n\\n[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank]\\nI go toot the horns and then ring the bell\\nBecause I am the man with the clientele\\nAnd if ya ask me why I rock so well\\nI\\'m Big Bank, I got clientele\\nAnd from the time I was only six years old\\nI never forgot what I was told\\nIt was the best advice that I ever had\\nIt came from my wise dear old dad\\nHe said, \"Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you\\nAnd don\\'t say a word until I\\'m through\\nNow there\\'s a time to laugh, a time to cry\\nA time to live and a time to die\\nA time to break and a time to chill\\nTo act civilized or act real ill\\nBut whatever ya do in your lifetime\\nYa never let a MC steal your rhyme\"\\nSo from \\'66 to this very day\\nI\\'ll always remember what he had to say\\nSo when the sucker MCs try to chump my style\\nI let them know that I\\'m versatile\\nI got style, finesse and a little black book\\nThat\\'s filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look\\nBut the thing that separates you from me\\nAnd that is called originality\\nBecause my rhymes are on from what you\\'ve heard\\nI didn\\'t even bite, not a god**** word\\nAnd I say a little more later on tonight\\nSo the sucker MCs can bite all night\\nA tick a tock, y\\'all, a beat-beat y\\'all\\nA lets rock, y\\'all, ya don\\'t stop\\n\\n[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\\nIt go, \"Hotel, motel, a whatcha gonna do today?\" (Say what?)\\n\\'Cause I\\'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, and drive off in a def OJ\\nEverybody go, \"Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\"\\nYou see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friends\\n\\n[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\\nA like that, y\\'all, a to the beat, y\\'all\\nA beat-beat, y\\'all, ya don\\'t stop\\nA Master Gee, am I mellow?\\nIt\\'s on you, so whatcha gonna do?\\n\\n[Verse 10: Master Gee]\\nWell, like Johnny Carson on the late show\\nA like Frankie Crocker in stereo\\nA like the Bar-Kays singing \"Holy Ghost\"\\nThe sounds I throw down, a they\\'re played the most\\nJust a like my man, a Captain Sky\\nWhose name he earned with his super sperm\\nWe rock and we don\\'t stop\\nA get off, y\\'all, I\\'m here to give you whatcha got\\nA to the beat that it makes you freak\\nAnd come alive girl, a get on your feet\\nA like a Perry Mason without a case\\nLike Farrah Fawcett without her face\\nLike the Bar-Kays on the mic\\nLike getting right down for you tonight\\nLike moving your body so ya don\\'t know how\\nRight to the rhythm and throw down\\nLike coming alive to the Master Gee\\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\\nI said the age of one, my life begun\\nAt the age of two, I was doing the do\\nAt the age of three, it was you and me\\nRocking to the sounds of the Master Gee\\nAt the age of four, I was on the floor\\nGiving all the freaks what they bargained for\\nAt the age of five, I didn\\'t take no jive\\n\\'Cause with the Master Gee, it\\'s all the way live\\nAt the age of six, I was a picking up sticks\\nRapping to the beat, my stick was fixed\\nAt the age of seven, I was rocking in heaven\\nDon\\'t ya know I went off?\\nI gotta run on down to the beat, you see\\nGetting right on down, making all the girls\\nJust take off their clothes to the beat, the beat\\nTo the double beat-beat that makes you freak\\nAt the age of eight I was a really great\\n\\'Cause every night, you see, I had a date\\nAt the age of nine I was a right on time\\n\\'Cause every night I had a party rhyme\\nWe\\'re going on and on, and on, on and on\\nThe beat don\\'t stop until the break of dawn\\nA saying on and on, and on, on and on\\nLike a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn\\nA going on and on, and don\\'t ya dare stop\\nA rock-rock, y\\'all, a gimme what ya got\\n\\'Cause I\\'m a hell of a man when I\\'m on the mic\\nAnd I am the definite freak\\'s delight\\nI\\'m a hell of a man when I\\'m on the mic\\nI am the definite freak\\'s delight\\nThey call me the Master Gee, you see\\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\\n\\n[Outro: Master Gee]\\nI\\'m gonna move ya here, I\\'m gonna move ya there\\nI\\'m gonna move you outta this atmosphere\\n\\'Cause I\\'m one of a kind and I\\'ll shocks your mind\\nI\\'ll put the t-t-tickets in your behind\\nSaid, just rock it to the east and move it to the west\\nMove it toward the lady you

You look like you went through a cheese grater. Oh, snap, you Luke...\\n\\nLuke smacks Bryce hard enough to knock him into a display. Michael panics and shoots at Luke several times.\\n\\nMICHAEL: I ain\\'t mean that.\\n\\nLUKE: Give me your phone. The phone, fool.\\n\\nMICHAEL: Yo, my bad, man. You know, I just got a little nervous and shit when you threw my mans across the...\\n\\nLuke flicks Michael in the head and knocks him out.\\n\\nMETHOD MAN: It\\'s you. Yeah, it\\'s you.\\n\\nLUKE: No, man, it\\'s you. Yo, man, \"P.L.O. Style\" was my joint back in the day. Sweet Christmas. Yeah, man, one second.\\n\\nLuke makes a phone call.\\n\\nLUKE: Hey, it\\'s me...Yeah, they\\'ll be looking for me. I\\'ll lay in the cut. I\\'ll see you in a few.\\n\\nLuke puts the phone away, looks to Method Man.\\n\\nLUKE: You a double XL?\\n\\nMETHOD MAN: Way ahead of you, homie.\\n\\nThey trade hoodies. Luke takes a minute to destroy the robbers\\' gun.\\n\\nLUKE: Call the cops.\\n\\nBODEGA OWNER: I know a lot of people who would pay you for this kind of protection.\\n\\nLUKE: They can keep their money.\\n\\nMETHOD MAN: Salute...You ever see anything like that before?\\n\\nBODEGA OWNER: Harlem, baby. Harlem.\\n\\nTHE STATIONHOUSE\\nMisty is walking down the hall. Her phone rings.\\n\\nMISTY: Hello?\\n\\nCANDACE: Detective Knight?\\n\\nMISTY: Candace?\\n\\nCANDACE: Yeah.\\n\\nMISTY: What number are you calling me from?\\n\\nCANDACE: A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS. I need to see you.\\n\\nMISTY: Come into the precinct.\\n\\nCANDACE: No. No. You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.\\n\\nMISTY: You didn\\'t wanna talk to me before. What makes you trust me now?\\n\\nCANDACE: Because Luke Cage does. He saved my life. And you saw right through me. You want the truth, right?\\n\\nMISTY: Where are you?\\n\\nCANDACE: Look, if you can\\'t help...\\n\\nMISTY: Candace.\\n\\nCANDACE: Tell me a place, and I will be there.\\n\\nINTERROGATION ROOM\\n\\nRIDLEY: You should be at Rikers right now, but I held you because I think you have something to say.\\n\\nSHADES: Lawyer.\\n\\nRIDLEY: I know your record, Mr. Alvarez. Came up in Harlem, rolled around with Cottonmouth in the late \\'90s, spent some time at Spofford, Sing Sing, then you made it to the big time, went to Seagate.\\n\\nSHADES: Lawyer.\\n\\nRIDLEY: Cornell Stokes is dead, but you\\'re still alive. And I\\'ve never seen an arraignment happen so quickly. Two million dollar bail and someone paid it in cash. Who\\'s your new sponsor? Is it Willis Stryker?\\n\\nSHADES: Law...yer.\\n\\nRIDLEY: You were part of a hostage situation, Hernan. Even if your lawyer does get you out you won\\'t be walking away from that. That\\'s multiple kidnapping and weapons charges. How does 25 years to life sound to you? Minimum.\\n\\nSHADES: Are you serious?\\n\\nRIDLEY: Yep.\\n\\nSHADES: Okay. Okay. I I was in the club. I saw what happened. I know who did it.\\n\\nRIDLEY: Okay. We can protect you, but I need a name to verify. Who was it? Was it Stryker?\\n\\nSHADES: He goes by...lawyer. You need me to spell it?\\n\\nShades laughs Ridley out the door.\\nTHE WATERSIDE\\n\\nCANDACE: You call this safe?\\n\\nMISTY: We\\'re hiding in plain sight. I\\'ve got you...For now. Lie to me again, Candace, I walk away from here, and you are on your own.\\n\\nCANDACE: It\\'s not bullshit.\\n\\nMISTY: We\\'ll see. How did you even get out of Harlem\\'s Paradise without being stopped?\\n\\nCANDACE: They were so busy trying to arrest Luke, I just walked away.\\n\\nMISTY: So what is it? What do you need to tell me that\\'s so important?\\n\\nCANDACE: I was at the club the night Cottonmouth died.\\n\\nMISTY: I already know that.\\n\\nCANDACE: I mean right after.\\n\\nMisty deliberately takes out her phone and holds it up so Candace can see her touch the \"record\" button.\\n\\nCANDACE: Mariah killed him.\\n\\nMisty pictures herself in Harlem\\'s Paradise as Shades and Mariah cover up the crime.\\n\\nSHADES (flashback):The trash bag is for the clothes you\\'re wearing now. Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too. Someone from Spurlock\\'s will incinerate them....The secret to any good lie is it has to run parallel to the truth....\\n\\nMISTY: How do you know this?\\n\\nCANDACE:  I heard them talking about it.\\n\\nSHADES (flashback): ...do what I say...\\n\\nCANDACE: The guy who always wears sunglasses, he was there. It was his idea to say Luke Cage killed Cottonmouth. I was so scared. I snuck out of there, back to the lockers.\\nAnd, um, I was trying to calm myself down. When I went upstairs, the guy with the glasses offered me $50,000 to tell a story. So I told one.\\n\\nMISTY: Why are you coming clean now?\\n\\nCANDACE: \\'Cause I can\\'t live with this. Especially after Luke saving my life. If you can guarantee my safety, I will testify about everything I just told you.\\n\\nMisty stops recording and puts her phone away.\\n\\nMariah scares me more than Cottonmouth. I asked her if she thought Luke did it, mostly to see if I could trust her. To see if she would tell me the truth. She looked me right in my eye and said \"You never know what anyone is capable of.\" It was the way she said it. She...she would kill me if she knew I was speaking to you, I truly believe that. Thank you for helping me.\\n\\nMISTY: I\\'m gonna nail Mariah Dillard\\'s ass to the wall. Who else knows that you\\'re here?\\n\\nCANDACE: Just my friend Leslie.\\n\\nMISTY: Don\\'t call anyone else, not even Leslie. As a matter of fact, give me your phone. Come on.\\n\\nCANDACE: Okay.\\n\\nMisty hands her a new burner.\\n\\nMISTY: Now, I picked this up on the way, just in case. It\\'s already got my number programed in there, so if I call or text, you know it\\'s me.\\n\\nCANDACE: Is your arm okay?\\n\\nMISTY:  My trigger finger is just fine.\\nCome on, let\\'s go.\\n\\nCANDACE: Where?\\n\\nMISTY: Soledad\\'s. Her daughter Claire is the one who treated your ankle at Harlem\\'s Paradise. She\\'ll be there, too. I\\'m gonna take you there myself.\\n\\nNearby, Alex watches them from a car.\\nSWAY\\'S STUDIO\\n\\nMETHOD MAN: No lie. Bullets was flying everywhere and shit.\\n\\nHEATHER B:You trying to tell me that those are bullet holes? Man, Meth, I love you, but get out of here. I don\\'t believe that.\\n\\nMETHOD MAN: HB, I thought the same thing until shorty pulled the biscuit and let two off on Cage and they bounced off. Bullets ricochetin\\' and shit. Look, I\\'m telling y\\'all the truth. I see y\\'all over there, y\\'all don\\'t believe it.\\nTrust me, it\\'s the truth. And after he smacked fire out these dudes, he left the hoodie, told me and Gomez to call the police...You know I ain\\'t calling no po-po...Then he bounced.\\n\\nSWAY: Say word.\\n\\nMETHOD MAN: Word, Sway. I\\'m telling you. He even balled the dude\\'s gun up like some old homework.\\n\\nHEATHER B: But my thing is, though, if he innocent, so what he running for?\\n\\nMETHOD MAN: Bulletproof always gonna come second to being black. HB, you should know that. You from Jers. Jers!\\n\\nSWAY: Wow! Sound like he stunted on you right there.\\n\\nHEATHER B: He did stunt. It was a stunt. It was a stunt. Why you gotta stunt on me?\\n\\nMETHOD MAN: No, I mean, seriously. Seriously, though, what I\\'m just saying, like, if that was me, and I was on the run...Why even get involved? But he did. And those dudes was nervous, so anything could\\'ve happened. As far as I\\'m concerned, Luke Cage saved my life, man.\\n\\nSWAY: That\\'s what\\'s up, man. You know what, that don\\'t sound like no cop killer to me.\\n\\nMETHOD MAN: For real, for real. You know, there\\'s somethin\\' powerful about seeing a black man that\\'s bulletproof and unafraid. Come on, y\\'all. You know? Streets got mad love for Cage. I got mad love for Cage, man, and and he one of ours.\\n\\nSWAY: But you know what? We got mad love for you, too.\\n\\nHEATHER B: No doubt.\\n\\nSWAY: You one of ours, man. You know, the show\\'s almost over, man. You gonna spit for us?\\n\\nMETHOD MAN: Of course.\\n\\nSWAY: Oh, man! He \\'bout to spit! Citizens, you are in for a treat. One of the best to pick up the mic, the one and only Method Man!\\n\\nMETHOD MAN: Hey, yo, Sway. You all ready? I\\'mma dedicate this one to the hardest individual on the street right now. Luke Cage, you already know. \"Bulletproof Love\" your way, brother.\\nDuring this song we see a montage of cops trying to track down Luke Cage, stopping black men with bullet-riddled hoodies. However, the whole of Harlem has started to wear them. Gomez the bodega owner is selling them to a huge crowd.\\n\\nLet\\'s get it.\\nListen.\\nMan, it is what it is\\nCan\\'t understand a man if you ain\\'t lived what he lived\\nRoaches in the crib, ain\\'t got no food up in the fridge\\nPlus the crime running rampant and it\\'s screwing up the kids\\nSway, admit, what kind of paradise is this?\\nI just want my 40 acres and some carats on the wrist\\nBut these snakes is trying to gather in the pit\\nWhen you get a cottonmouth, plucking ashes off the clip\\nOff the rip, now a challenger exists\\nAnd he bulletproof, shoot, what kind of caliber is this?\\nGot thugs in the store with the barrel on your lips\\nSaying, \"empty out the drawer\" before he pound you with the grip\\nLord, who to call when no one obeys the law\\nAnd there ain\\'t no Iron Man that can come and save us all?\\nPower to the people and Luke Cage the cause\\nAnd the cops got it wrong, we don\\'t think Cage involved\\nLook, dog, a hero, never had one\\nAlready took Malcolm and Martin, this is the last one\\nI beg your pardon, somebody pulling a fast one\\nNow we got a hero for hire and he a black one\\nAnd bullet-hole hoodies is the fashion\\nWe in Harlem\\'s Paradise, tell the Captain\\nThat I\\'m about to trade the mic for a Magnum\\nGive up my life for Trayvon to have one\\n\\n[Hook: Method Man]\\nYeah, \\'cause this is bulletproof love\\nAnd you already know what a bulletproof does\\nSo you can take it from a bulletproof thug\\nThe hood got his back, dog, bulletproof love\\nThe blood thicker than mud\\nAnd who am I to judge if you get a gun in the club?\\n\\'Cause you already know what a bulletproof does\\nWhen the hood got your back, dog, bulletproof love\\n\\n[Outro: Method Man]\\nYeah, shoutout to Pop. RIP, my brother. The streets is crazy nowadays. People say we don\\'t need another hero, but now we got one whether you like it or not. Luke Cage, please believe it, sir. The streets got your back. You already bulletproof love, baby\\nThe streets is crazy right now, you know what I\\'m sayin\\'? People say we don\\'t need another hero, but now we got one. Whether you like it or not, Luke Cage, please believe it, sir, the streets got your back. You\\'re already bulletproof love, baby!\\n\\nSWAY: Yeah! That was dope. You got it right here on Sway\\'s Universe. The homie, Method Man, HB, and the bulletproof thug, Luke Cage.\\nLaw enforcement is in a frenzy looking for Luke Cage.\\n\\nTHE BARBERSHOP\\n\\nTHEMBI WALLACE NEWSCAST: There have been numerous false sightings, with some people wearing hoodies with holes as a sign of solidarity with an outlaw some people still perceive to be a hero.\\n\\nSWAY: Sway in the Morning. What\\'s on your mind, citizen?\\n\\nCALLER: Yo, I remember when Larry Davis was on the run back in the day. Cops came at him \\'cause they were just as corrupt, dangerous and jacked up as he was. I don\\'t think we\\'re getting the full story on Luke Cage yet, for real.\\n\\nFish is listening to Sway and watching Thembi on the news at the Barbershop.\\n\\nSWAY: I wouldn\\'t put it past the government, man. Um, you know, we\\'re gonna be searching for the answers for you, and once we get the facts, we\\'re gonna put it right here on Sway\\'s Universe, all right? Thanks for your call, citizen. We got another person on the line...\\n\\nFish changes the station to jazz. Plainclothes officers rush in to raid the shop.\\n\\nOFFICERS: Now! Come on! All right.\\n\\nFISH: Oh, come on, man. You know he\\'s not here.\\n\\nSmith walks over to Fish\\'s chessboard.\\n\\nSMITH: I understand playing against the computer, but, um, how do you beat yourself?\\n\\nFISH: Chess is a game of anticipation. If you know every single possible move, you can anticipate your adversary\\'s next move before he does.\\n\\nSMITH: Oh. That\\'s deep. If we find out you\\'ve been hiding him, there\\'ll be hell to pay.\\n\\nFISH: Yeah, well, just don\\'t break the hinges on that door on your way out. I just got it fixed.\\nThe cops drive away. Luke watches them go and comes into the shop.\\n\\nFISH: That was a close shave.\\n\\nLUKE: Bad pun.\\n\\nFISH: What the hell did you even come back for, man?\\n\\nLUKE: I had to. For Harlem. Take care of Diamondback before he made it bad for everybody.\\n\\nFISH: Well, forget Harlem. Forget your brother! You\\'re on the road in a brand new car and a woman that fine? And you\\'re bulletproof. You\\'d have never seen my black ass again. I\\'d rob the occasional bank and never look back. You got every cop in the city looking for you, brother. Negroes writing Luke Cage ballads and shit. So what\\'s the plan?\\n\\nLUKE: To box in all the players.\\n\\nFISH: Well, Shades is in jail. Mariah\\'s out, but she ain\\'t exactly on your side. Now you could tail both of \\'em, but no telling how long that\\'ll take for them to lead you to your prey. What about Misty?\\n\\nLUKE:  No, she\\'s got her hands full already. She\\'s trying to clear my name inside the precinct and bring me in at the same time. We gotta be careful with her.\\n\\nFISH: That leaves you one other option. Someone else to find Diamondback. Here. Turk.\\n\\nFish gets up and goes to the wall phone.\\n\\nLUKE: Turk may be a pawn, but he\\'s not dumb. If he thinks he\\'s being set up, he\\'ll disappear.\\n\\nFISH: You let me worry about that. Hey, Turk, it\\'s Bobby. Listen, I might be able to get my hands on about 30 pairs of Jordans. They\\'re the vintage Air Jordan 5s.\\nLet\\'s just say they fell off the back of a truck...Okay, when?\\n\\nINTERROGATION ROOM\\nRidley walks in with an unfamiliar woman.\\n\\nSHADES: Who\\'s this?\\n\\nRIDLEY: First name \"Law,\" last name \"Yer.\" Must be pretty damn connected to get a lawyer and not even know who she is.\\n\\nSHADES: Membership has its privileges.\\n\\nIn the hall, Misty bumps into Shades on his way out.\\n\\nMISTY: He sprung you? You think this is funny, don\\'t you? You got this all figured out, huh?\\n\\nSHADES: No. Actually, I don\\'t.\\n\\nUNDER A BRIDGE\\nZip, Shades, and some minions get out of a car.\\n\\nSHADES: When did Diamondback bring in new hires?\\n\\nZIP: Well, after the club, he had to change things up. Recruit some new faces.\\n\\nThey all walk into an abandoned factory.\\n\\nZIP: I bet while you were inside, cops tried to do some recruiting of their own.\\n\\nSHADES: Don\\'t ever question my loyalty.\\n\\nThey all step into a old service elevator.\\n\\nSHADES: The man upstairs?\\n\\nZIP:  You are just full of questions. Matter of fact...\\n\\nZip wraps a cord around Shades\\' neck to strangle him. The other minions wait impassively. Shades struggles until he grabs a minion\\'s gun and starts shooting, taking out the minions before even breaking free from Zip. He turns on Zip last, holding the gun on him.\\n\\nSHADES: Let\\'s go to the penthouse.\\n\\nTHE ROOF\\n\\nZIP: I was just following orders!\\n\\nSHADES: You\\'re a goddamn puppet. Who gave you the order? Who?\\n\\nZIP: Diamondback! You stopped playing your position. Asked too many questions. Diamondback said you needed to be dealt with.\\n\\nSHADES: Romeo would be ashamed of you. You\\'re such a disappointment.\\n\\nZIP: You\\'re the second person who told me that today. I\\'m my own man, Shades.\\n\\nSHADES: Tell him yourself.\\n\\nShades shoots Zip in the head. He finds the sunglasses in Zip\\'s pocket.\\n\\nSHADES: Nice...Sorry, Romeo He had to go.\\n\\nMARIAH\\'S BROWNSTONE\\n\\nMARIAH: It\\'s a good thing her friend Leslie knew where she was. I\\'m glad you found the park. So where is she now?\\n\\nALEX: She left with Detective Knight. Traffic got thick and I lost them. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m not used to doing anything like this.\\n\\nMARIAH: We\\'ll find her again. Just knowing that she can\\'t be trusted is helpful. You did a good job, Alex. Hey, you\\'re my rock! Later.\\n\\nMariah\\'s phone rings. She puts in an earbud before she answers to speak on her headset.\\n\\nMARIAH: What do you want?\\n\\nSTRYKER (over the phone): That\\'s no way to speak to a business partner.\\n\\nMARIAH: After what you did to my club, do you really think I\\'m gonna shuck and jive with you?\\n\\nSTRYKER (over the phone): You might wanna check your attitude. If you\\'re not of any use to me, then you\\'re not useful to anyone. Shades would tell you, if he was still alive.\\n\\nMARIAH: What the hell are you talking about?\\n\\nSTRYKER (over the phone): I had to let him go.\\nSo now, I\\'m giving you the chance to tell me where you stand. I\\'ve taken Shades and Damon Boone off the table so you can grow. I\\'d hate for us to part, too.\\n\\nMARIAH: I wasn\\'t particularly fond of Shades and the death of Damon Boone, although unnecessary, was appreciated. But you need to know this. I\\'m out of the political game. I\\'m focusing on Harlem\\'s Paradise. Using it for a a power base for community relations.\\n\\nInstead of answering over the phone, Styker comes into the room.\\n\\nSTRYKER: That\\'s a smart move. But you\\'ve made some dumb ones also. You should never talk about murder on an open line.\\n\\nHe drops a duffel bag in front of her.\\n\\nSTRYKER: Open it. Seed money for your New Harlem Renaissance project and refurbishing the club. My apologies.\\n\\nMARIAH: It\\'s a very generous donation but nothing in this world is free.\\n\\nSTRYKER: You\\'re right. My only condition is loyalty. Stick with me and Harlem will be remade in your own image. We\\'ll be doing this for years to come.\\n\\nMARIAH: Harlem is already in my image. You staying?\\n\\nSTRYKER: Once I\\'m finished with Carl, I\\'ll evaporate. But don\\'t worry. You\\'ll still feel the occasional cool breeze. Sweet dreams, Mariah.\\n\\nTHE STREETS OF HARLEM\\nTurk is walking down the street. Luke grabs him and pulls him into an alley.\\n\\nLUKE: You ratted out Chico. You got Pop killed.\\n\\nTURK: Man, the writing was on the wall. Somebody would have seen him. Might as well be me. How was I supposed to know Tone was gonna shoot up the shop? Whole damn world know Pop\\'s was Switzerland. Forever.\\n\\nLUKE: I should crush you.\\n\\nTURK: You won\\'t, though. You need me.\\n\\nLUKE: Where\\'s Diamondback?\\n\\nTURK: I don\\'t know.\\n\\nLuke picks Turk up and holds him high in the air, then throws him into a dumpster and starts to crush it around Turk\\'s body.\\n\\nLUKE: You still stalling?\\n\\nTURK: All right! All right! He\\'s at a warehouse by the Harlem River. Near 145th, all right? I gave you what you wanted! Now let me out!\\n\\nLUKE: Sit tight, Mr. Barrett. Trash pickup is tomorrow. You can breathe just fine. There\\'s food in there, too.\\n\\nTURK: You can\\'t leave me in here! There\\'s baby diapers in here, man! Hey! Come on!\\n\\nDIAMONDBACK\\'S WAREHOUSE\\nDomingo and his minions are walking through the abandoned warehouse.\\n\\nDOMINGO: Looks like you downgraded. I liked the club better.\\n\\nSTRYKER: I\\'m a man who needs his space.\\n\\nDOMINGO: Space is a good thing. Especially when you come to kill a man.\\n\\nSTRYKER: Whoa, whoa.\\n\\nDomingo and his guys pull their guns on the seemingly lone Stryker. Stryker\\'s men emerge from the shadows, equally armed.\\n\\nDOMINGO: Someone did your boy Zip and his two homies. That\\'s not Cage\\'s style so I\\'m guessing Shades didn\\'t appreciate you bailing him out.\\n\\nSTRYKER: You know when a rattlesnake is at its most dangerous, Domingo? When it\\'s cornered.\\n\\nStryker pulls out his guns and starts shooting. There is a long shootout.\\n\\nDOMINGO: I\\'m gonna rip your head off!\\n\\nEventually Stryker escapes the melee and goes into another room. He opens a crate and a red glow illuminates his face.\\n\\nSTRYKER: \"And behold a pale horse and he that sat upon him, his name was Death.\"\\nMARIAH\\'S BROWNSTONE\\nMariah is counting Stryker\\'s cash and drinking. She gets up and opens a gold box in her living room that has the pearl-handled gun that Cottonmouth used to kill Uncle Pete. Shades comes into the room.\\n\\nSHADES: You really need a security system. You waiting for me?\\n\\nMARIAH: No.\\n\\nSHADES: I bet he told you I was dead. Diamondback got to you, didn\\'t he?\\n\\nMARIAH: No, he didn\\'t.\\n\\nSHADES: What are you doing with a gun? It\\'s not you.\\n\\nMARIAH: Shut up.\\n\\nSHADES: I have something for you. Figured you\\'d want this.\\n\\nHe holds out the bottle she used to hit Cottonmouth over the head when she killed him.\\n\\nSHADES: Your prints, Cornell\\'s blood.\\n\\nMARIAH: Then you\\'ll have nothing to blackmail me with.\\n\\nSHADES: I don\\'t need it. We\\'re in this together now.\\n\\nMARIAH: You and I have come a long way. You know, sometimes you have to reach across the aisle to get things done.\\n\\nSHADES: You\\'re talking about Luke Cage? It\\'s incredible how much you and I think alike. We\\'re at war. And right now, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\\n\\nMARIAH: Maybe. But it might not take. You did beat his ass and give him his powers. And Cornell\\'s flunky killed Pop. You think he really is gonna jump? Just jump on our bandwagon?\\n\\nSHADES: Absolutely. \\'Cause we have something that he wants more than anything.\\n\\nHe pulls an official looking manila envelope out of his bag.\\n\\nHis old life. A chance to clear his name. Right here.\\n\\nMARIAH: If we send Luke after Diamondback and they kill each other all of our problems are swept away. No matter who wins.\\n\\nSHADES: Even better.\\n\\nDIAMONDBACK\\'S WAREHOUSE\\nLuke breaks the metal door down and sees the results of the firefight. The warehouse is filled with dead bodies. He finds Domingo Colon, who isn\\'t quite dead yet.\\n\\nDOMINGO: I should\\'ve known you\\'d turn up.\\n\\nLUKE: What the hell happened here?\\n\\nDOMINGO: Diamondback.\\n\\nLuke hears beeping. He follows it to that side room and finds Stryker\\'s crate. It has a bomb inside with a countdown at 45 seconds.\\n\\nLUKE: Sweet sister.\\n\\nCut to Luke running out of the warehouse carrying Domingo.\\n\\nLUKE: Slow. Take it easy. What did he use? How did Diamondback do that?\\n\\nDOMINGO: Something I\\'ve never seen before. Even you can\\'t stop him.\\n\\nDomingo dies.\\nTHE STATIONHOUSE\\nThe shot of Domingo\\'s death becomes a crime scene photo on Misty\\'s wall.\\n\\nMISTY: These just came in.\\n\\nBAILEY: Elephant punches all over again.\\n\\nMISTY: Mmm-hmm.\\n\\nBAILEY:That\\'s gotta be Cage, right?\\n\\nMisty\\'s cell phone rings.\\n\\nMISTY: Hello?\\n\\nLUKE (over the phone): Hey, it\\'s me. You guys find Domingo?\\n\\nMISTY: Yeah.\\n\\nLUKE: Meet me.\\n\\nMISTY: Where?\\n\\nShe quickly gathers her things and leaves.\\nTHE STREETS OF HARLEM\\nMisty stops in front of the grated window of an abandoned building. Luke is inside, talking to her through the window.\\n\\nMISTY: Should I thank you for this?\\n\\nLUKE: All credit goes to Diamondback.\\n\\nMISTY: I don\\'t suppose we\\'ll find his body. We found Zip\\'s, though, and two other thugs in an old building. Shot up. Right after they picked up your other boy.\\n\\nLUKE: Shades. Don\\'t you ever get tired of people getting out?\\n\\nMISTY: Yes. Look, it\\'s not safe for you to be here. If you don\\'t find Diamondback...\\n\\nLUKE: Then he wins, and my life is forever a living hell.\\n\\nMISTY: Is there anything I can do?\\n\\nLUKE: See what else Turk knows. He\\'s in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd. Near Mount Olivet and the shop.\\n\\nMISTY: A dumpster?\\n\\nOUTSIDE MOUNT OLIVET CHURCH\\nMariah and Shades are sitting in a car.\\n\\nMARIAH: Even if we handle Diamondback he\\'s not gonna forgive us for framing him for Cornell\\'s death.\\n\\nSHADES: We could hurdle that easy. The only people who know what really happened in the club are you and me.\\n\\nMARIAH: I\\'ll regret that night for the rest of my life.\\n\\nSHADES: You did what you had to do. You shouldn\\'t regret that.\\n\\nMARIAH: What were you even doing at the club that night?\\n\\nSHADES: I was going there to kill him. You beat me to it.\\n\\nMARIAH: Cornell never needed my political money. And he was never going to pay it back. He just wanted me in all the way.\\n\\nSHADES: So what are you saying?\\n\\nMARIAH: He saw things in me that I avoided my whole life. Now I am becoming that person he always saw and I always denied.\\n\\nSHADES: You ready?\\n\\nMARIAH: I stay ready, baby.\\n\\nThey climb out of the car and walk into\\nTHE BARBERSHOP\\n\\nFISH: I should\\'ve kept my coat on. Hell just froze over.\\n\\nMARIAH: Where\\'s Luke Cage?\\n\\nLUKE: I\\'m right here.\\n\\nSHADES:We have a problem.\\n\\nLUKE: So do I. I can\\'t decide which one of you I\\'m gonna knock out first. Where\\'s Diamondback?\\n\\nSHADES: I don\\'t know. The parley between the three of us is more important.\\n\\nLUKE: You have the nerve to use that term? Right here? Where Pop died? Cough up Diamondback\\'s location, or I\\'ll stomp you like we were back at Seagate.\\n\\nFISH: Luke, be cool, brother.\\n\\nMARIAH: Whoa, whoa. No one needs to stomp anyone. Pops made this place Switzerland for a reason. Cage, we have a mutual enemy, and the only way to bring him down is for us all to come together.\\n\\nLUKE: There\\'s no way I\\'m helping you.\\n\\nMARIAH: We came to offer you a truce. In exchange for helping you find Diamondback, you drop your beef with us.\\n\\nLUKE: You both framed me for murder. There\\'s nothing you can offer me that\\'s going to make me let that go.\\n\\nSHADES: How about your freedom? Right here is everything you need to prove that Diamondback framed Carl Lucas.\\n\\nLUKE: Even if Carl Lucas is exonerated Luke Cage is now wanted for the murder of Cottonmouth.\\n\\nMARIAH: I\\'ll tell them the truth. Diamondback killed Cornell and Damon Boone. You\\'ll go free.\\n\\nMisty emerges from the back room.\\n\\nSHADES:What the hell is this?\\n\\nMISTY: Mariah Dillard, you\\'re under arrest for the murder of Cornell Stokes.\\n\\nLUKE: I thought you said you were going after Turk?\\n\\nMISTY: I\\'ve been tracking you since you called. I wasn\\'t going to let you just ghost me again.\\n\\nLUKE: Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shades, back off! Misty, stand down. We\\'re working this out.\\n\\nMISTY: Oh, so you workin\\' with them now?\\n\\nLUKE: He knows where Diamondback is.\\n\\nSHADES: I didn\\'t say that.\\n\\nMISTY: Well, whatever you know, Hernan, you should share it with the whole class.\\n\\nSHADES: I ain\\'t telling you shit.\\n\\nSomething drops to the ground right outside the shop.\\n\\nLUKE: Grenade!\\n\\nEveryone drops to the ground (with Luke between them and the door) to cover their heads. The grenade goes off, blowing out all the windows of the shop. In the chaos Misty drops her phone and Shades picks it up. Stryker comes in wearing a green suit and helmet.\\n\\nFISH: What the hell? What type of Jean Paul Gaultier shit is this? What are you, a pimp stormtrooper?\\n\\nSTRYKER: No, I\\'m the angel of death.\\n\\nSHADES (aside to Mariah): You told him to meet us here?\\n\\nMARIAH: No.\\n\\nSTRYKER: Damn!

       " 'Our story begins with the classic 007 opening, except this time it’s Pierce Brosnan wearing the tux.\\n1 - Ext. Top of Dam - Day\\nA plane does a fly-by over a dam as a security gate slides open. A man in combat black runs across the top of the tall dam. He clips a rope to his ankle and the railing...and jumps off the side. As he sails down, he pulls out a gun-type thing and shoots it. A wire follows attaching in concrete and pulling the man down to....\\n“Archangel Chemical Weapons Facility, USSR”\\nCut to a laser burning through a metal wall, being shot by the man with the gunthing. We see a blue eye, but we haven’t seen this guy’s face yet.....\\n2 - Int. Bathroom - Day\\nInside the plant, we cut to the men’s room, where we see Russians walking around. Above one of the stalls...\\n“Man in black’s” P.O.V. - a Soviet in uniform sitting on the can, reading a newspaper titled Pravda (\"The Truth\").\\nThe man in black takes the steel grate out and we see a silhouette. Soviet’s P.O.V. - The newspaper, printed in Russian, duh. He pulls the paper back to reveal.... James Bond. Hanging upside down from a vent. He flashes a grin.\\nBOND: Beg your pardon, forgot to knock.\\n007 punches out the Soviet and slips down.\\n3 - Int. Hallway - Same time\\nBond slips un-noticed through dim halls, wielding his Walther PPK with a silencer on it. He spots a butcher loading meat onto a cart, and he walks up to an opening where he sees soldiers eating. As he turns away...another dark shadow points a gun at him...and says something.\\nSHADOW: (Russian) Where have you been? Where are your companions?\\nBOND: I’m alone.\\nAlec Trevelyan, 006, steps into the light. He\\'s around Bond\\'s general age and built. Blond with cold eyes...\\nALEC: Aren’t we all? You’re late 007.\\nBOND: I had to stop in the bathroom.\\nALEC: Ready to save the world again?\\nBOND: After you, 006.\\nThey remove another steel grate.\\nALEC: James, for England.\\nBOND: For England, Alec.\\n4 - Int. Hall - Day\\nBond’s blue eyes spot someone in the hall. Waiting ‘til the coast is clear, he jumps out of the vent in the floor while Alec climbs out. Both men walk down the hall. Alec enters a laboratory with a plate-glass window and shoots the guy inside. Meanwhile, Bond has a device plugged into and ID card slot with a number pad under it. He waits for a click,\\nand the door unlocks. Both men walk inside....\\n5 - Int. Gas room - Day\\n...A room filled with nerve gas tanks.\\nBOND: It’s too easy.\\nALEC: Half of everything is luck, James.\\nAlec turns and plugs the device into the same panel, jamming the door.\\nBOND: And the other half?\\nALEC: Fate!\\nA red light sounds, signaling the alarm of the plant. The men run down the stairs.\\nALEC: Set timers to six minutes!\\nBOND: Six minutes, check.\\nA few Soviets burst through a door, 006 shoots them. Bond starts to arm a little explosive timer. A digital clock pops up...6.00. James and Alec scurry around behind the gas tanks planting the timers. An ugly-looking Soviet commander, Ourumov, stands behind a plexi-glass window.\\nOURUMOV:  FIRE!\\nSoldiers fire their guns, breaking the window. 006 and 007 are still planting the timers.\\nALEC: Closing time, James! Last call!\\nBOND: Buy me a pint!\\nThe Soviets pour through the opening. Trevelyan fires at them.\\nOURUMOV (O.S.): I am Colonel Ourumov. Come out with your hands above your heads!\\nWhile planting a timer...\\nBOND: How original.\\nMore Soviets pour through a door.\\nBOND: Shut the door, Alec! There’s a draft!\\nNo answer.\\nBOND: Alec?!\\nHe looks for 006. Alec in kneeling under the gun of Ourumov. Thirty soldiers all have their guns pointed at Bond.\\nOURUMOV:  Move out! Throw down your weapon and walk towards me. Slowly.\\nALEC: Finish the job, James! Blow them all to hell!\\nOURUMOV:  You have 10 seconds. 10...9...8...\\nBond goes back to the detonator he just planted and sets it for 3.00.\\nOURUMOV:  ....7...6..5...4..\\nBond throws his weapon on the floor, puts his hands behind his head and approaches Ourumov.\\nOURUMOV:  ...3......2....\\nALEC: For England, James!!\\nBOOM. Alec is silenced. He flops over. The Soviet soldiers fire their automatic rifles.\\nBond retreats behind the tanks again.\\nOURUMOV:  Hold your fire! You’ll blow the gas tanks!\\nThey do. Bond recovers his gun.\\nOURUMOV:  This is your last chance! Come out with your hands above your head....\\nOurumov’s P.O.V. - a dark shadow moves behind a cart with tanks piled on it. The soldiers raise their guns...\\nOURUMOV:  WAIT!\\nBond moves slowly with the cart acting as a shield. Ourumov seems amused....one soldier thinks he can get a shot off...and fires. Bond retreats farther behind the cart. Ourumov turns and shoots the guy in the face...he warned him.\\nOURUMOV:  You can’t win.\\nYeah, sure. Bond quickly hits the “on” button to a conveyer belt leading outside. He jumps on and fires the assault rifle. The Soviets fire back, but Bond hits the grate to a storage area above their heads. More gas tanks pour out on the Soviets. And Bond tumbles down the conveyer belt onto...\\n6 - Ext. Runway - Day\\nBond sees a small plane....his ticket outta here. More soldiers burst through a hangar door and what’s behind door number 2...even more pour out onto the runway. Bond crouches behind some piping and fires, hitting a few. The gun runs out and he dashes through the snow toward the plane. We hear Ourumov’s shouting in the backround.\\nOURUMOV:  Hold your fire!\\nCut to 1000 yards out: the facility is on a mountain-top. Cliffs, very high up. Back to the action...Bond runs down the plane and drags himself inside, fights with the pilot. Now there’s soldiers chasing Bond on motorcycles. Both 007 and the pilot tumble out of the plane. A motorcycle runs over the pilot, causing the bike to throw its rider. Bond\\njumps on the bike and chases the runaway plane.\\nOURUMOV:  WAIT!!\\nThe plane sails off the cliff, and so does the motorcycle with 007 still on it. He flies off the bike and sails to the dive-bombing plane. He grabs the open door and pulls himself inside and into the pilot’s seat. Uh-oh! The stick’s not working, not responding! Oh crap!\\nWe see Bond’s blue eyes start to panic...then just in time the plane soars upward as the chemical weapons facility explodes.\\nFade up on...\\n\\nTitle Sequence, scored by “GoldenEye” sung by Tina Turner\\n\\n7 - Int. Car/Ext. Road - Day\\nWe shoot onto an open road with the vrroom of an engine behind us. James’ personal choice of car, a silver Aston Martin DB5, license plate BMT 216A. The DB5 swerves around a tight corner at 90 mph. Fade up title...\\n“Nine Years Later”\\nBond, of course, is behind the wheel and a young woman sits beside him, visibly agitated. Her name is Caroline, but it doesn’t come up in the text.\\nCAROLINE: James, is it really necessary to drive quite so fast?!\\nBOND: More often than you’d think.\\nA red Ferrari comes into view in the rear mirror.\\nCAROLINE: I enjoy a spirited ride as much as the next girl...\\nJames flashes an intoxicating grin...as the Ferrari pulls up beside him. There’s a beautiful brunette behind the wheel. James loves this...\\nCAROLINE: Who’s that?\\nBOND: The next girl.\\nThe Ferrari passes him and plays a little road rash...nearly crashing into an oncoming tractor, spinning out of the way. James is loving every minute. Caroline is now really pissed off...\\nCAROLINE: James, stop this! Stop it! I know what you’re doing...\\nBOND: Really? What’s that, dear?\\nCAROLINE: You’re just trying to show off the size of your...your...\\nBOND: Engine?\\nCAROLINE: Ego.\\nBOND: Here we are having a pleasant drive in the country and you’ve got to bring psychology into it.\\nCAROLINE: Well, I was just sent out here to evaluate you.\\nBOND: Let’s try and put that behind us, shall we?\\nThe DB5 and Ferrari are still doin’ 90 around a corner when a pack of cyclists are pedaling up a hill. 007 let’s the car pass him...\\nBOND: Ladies first.\\nCaroline seems to be praying. The red Ferrari brushes past the first biker, knocking him down and the rest fall over in succession. Caroline’s had enough.\\nCAROLINE: James, I want you to stop this car!\\nBOND: Really?\\nCAROLINE: STOP THIS CAR AT ONCE!!\\nJames pulls the brake and the car screeches to a halt. He puts his arm around her.\\nBOND: As you can see, I have no problem with female authority.\\nShe flips open a box with two glasses and a bottle of Bollinger champagne in it. She looks pleased for once.\\nCAROLINE: James, you’re incorrigible. What am I going to do with you?\\nHe moves in closer....\\nBOND: Let’s toast your evaluation, shall we?\\nThey kiss...\\nBOND: A very...thorough...evaluation.\\nShe giggles, they kiss and we pan up on the skyline of Monte Carlo.\\n8 - Ext. Posh party - Night\\nThe Astor Martin DB5 drives up to a elegant-looking hotel, with a parking valet.\\nVALET: (French) Good evening Mr. Bond. Nice to see you tonight.\\nBOND: (French) Good evening, Pierre. How are things?\\nValet: (French) Very good, and you?\\nBond steps out of the DB5, looking dashing as usual in a tailored tuxedo, his black hair combed back. He spots the red Ferrari, parked. He enters the casino.\\n8 - Int. Hotel/Casino - Night\\nBond enters a ritzy lobby and nears a baccarat table. The dealer and a couple of people sit around playing.\\nDEALER: Sept à la banque. Ma’dam wins.\\nWe pan up on the driver of the expensive Italian sports car, who wears a black dress. Her name is Xenia Onatopp.\\nDEALER: Mademoiselle? Monsieurs. Ladies and Gentlemen? Players.\\nBond sits down at the table as Xenia is lighting up a cigar.\\nBOND: Banko.\\nThey proceed to play the game.\\nBOND: It appears we share the same passions. Well, three anyway.\\nXENIA:  I count two. Motoring and...uh...baccarat.\\nShe shows he cards\\nDEALER: Huit à la banque.\\nBond shows his cards.\\nDEALER: Seven. Ma’dam wins.\\nXENIA:  I hope the third is where your real talent lies.\\nBOND: One rises to meet a challenge.\\nThey place their bets.\\nXENIA:  Doubler.\\nBOND: Suivi.\\nThe dealer nods his head and passes cards. Bond looks at them.\\nBOND: Carte.\\nXenia shows her cards.\\nDEALER: Ma’dam stands with five.\\nBond shows his cards.\\nDEALER: Six. Ma’dam loses.\\nXenia is obviously mad.\\nXENIA:  (Russian)Dammit! (English) Enjoy it. While it lasts.\\nBOND: The very words I live by.\\nShe gets up from the table. James follows.\\nBOND: And what words do you live by?\\nXENIA:  The trick is to quit while you’re still ahead.\\nBOND: That’s one trick I never learned.\\nHe signals for a waiter to come over.\\nBOND: Perhaps you’ll show me how it’s done.\\nThe waiter approaches them. Here we go folks....\\nBOND: Vodka Martini. Shaken, not stirred. And for you?\\nXENIA:  The same.\\nBond is entranced.\\nBOND: How do you take it?\\nXENIA:  Straight up. With a twist.\\nThe waiter scurries away. Xenia fingers her cigar. So, she likes to play...\\nXENIA:  Thank you, Mr....\\nBOND: The name’s Bond. James Bond.\\nXENIA:  Xenia Zargeneva Onatopp.\\nBOND: Onatopp?\\nXENIA:  Onatopp.\\nBOND: Your accent, Georgian?\\nXENIA:  Very good Mr. Bond. You’ve been to Russia?\\nBOND: Not recently, I used to drop in occasionally. Shoot in and out.\\nXENIA:  It’s very different now. The land of opportunity.\\nBOND: With a new Ferrari in every garage?\\nXENIA:  No, not quite. That belongs to a friend.\\nBOND: A tip for your friend: the French registration plates for this year’s models start with the letter ‘L’. Even the counterfeit ones.\\nXenia is startled.\\nXENIA:  Oh, and what rank do you hold with the Motor Vehicles Department, Mr. Bond?\\nBOND: Commander.\\nNow a man steps up to Xenia. He’s a bald dude with a red beard. Looks like a  Canadian Admiral.\\nADMIRAL: Should we go?\\nXENIA:  This one is an Admiral.\\nBOND: I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank.\\nXENIA:  Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.\\nShe sounds really annoyed, and she storms away with the Canadian. Bond watches her.\\nBOND: The pleasure, I’m sure, was all mine.\\n9 - Ext. Amphitheater - Night\\nPeople are gathered on stone benches in an open amphitheater watching two ladies perform an act. One woman hands a rose to another girl dressed as a porcelain doll. The lady proceeds to control the ‘doll’ as she walks like a puppet over to a man in the audience. He takes it and the audience claps. Meanwhile, Bond walks up the stone stairs to the top of the theater, overlooking water. Bond’s P.O.V. - the Ferrari pulls up, and Xenia and the Admiral get out. Bond takes out a camera-thing from his pocket, and zooming in, he takes a picture of Xenia and the Canadian boarding a motorboat to take her to a yacht. Bond takes a picture of the boat - ‘Manticore’- and walks back to his DB5.\\n10 - Ext. DB5 / Int. DB5 - Night\\nBefore Bond gets into his car, he notices a very sophisticated, stealthy helicopter perched on top of a battleship. He gets in the car and pushes a button on the stereo. A piece of paper with the info of the pictures he just took. A voice starts...it’s Moneypenny. Bond looks at the pictures.\\nMONEYPENNY: (V.O.) Transmission begins from Monypenny. Identification confirmed. Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot. Current suspected links to the Janus crime syndicate, St. Petersburg. Yacht Manticore is leased to a known Janus corporate front. M authorizes you to observe Miss Onatopp but stipulates no...contact...without prior\\napproval. End transmission, Moneypenny. Good night, James. I trust you’ll stay...onatopp of things.\\nBond smirks. He knows exactly what she means. So do we....\\n11 - Int. Yacht Manticore - Night\\nXenia literally JUMPS on the Admiral. She’s in some black lingerie. They kiss ferociously, she bites him. Then she whispers something, flips him over and crushes his rib cage with her legs. The Admiral’s in a lot of PAIN.\\nADMIRAL: Xenia! I can’t BREATHE!!!\\nXenia grins and squeezes harder. A hand reaches into the Admiral’s coat, which is draped over a chair, and pulls out his Department of Defense ID card.\\n12 - Ext. Bay - Day\\nA motorboat speeds through the water.\\n13 - Ext. Yacht Manticore - Day\\nBond waits for a man in a striped shirt to pass before he jumps up on to the deck on the yacht. He walks toward a sliding glass door, opens it and enters.\\n14 - Int. Yacht Manticore - Day\\nFurnished with leather furniture, Bond makes his way to a window where he sees the motorboat speeding to the battleship with the chopper on the deck. He looks down into a brass doorknob and sees the reflection of the guy in the striped shirt coming at him. Bond spins around with a towel and knocks him down, then throws him down the stairs by wrapping the towel around his head. 007 wipes his face with the towel.\\n15 - Ext. Battleship - Day\\nAcross the bay, cars let off Naval, Army and Air Force Officers of different countries, as well as their escorts. A gloved hand shows the Admiral’s ID card for the Department of National Defense. We’re pretty sure it isn’t the Admiral... A band plays, officers mill around. The Captain salutes the ‘Admiral’.\\nCAPTAIN: My respects, Admiral.\\nThe officer kisses the hand of Xenia, who is standing beside the ‘Admiral’.\\nCAPTAIN: Delighted to have you aboard, mademoiselle.\\nAn emcee starts to talk.\\nM.C.: Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats on the upper deck for the demonstration of the aircraft.\\n16 - Int. Yacht - Day\\nBond is still looking around the boat, this time with the Walther drawn. He bursts through a door, looks in a cabinet. He’s in a bedroom now. James opens the closet door and...  The dead body of Admiral Chuck Farrel falls stiffly to the floor, naked. Bond is a little stunned...\\n17 - Ext. Yacht - Day\\nBond hops into a motorboat docked beside the yacht. He starts it up and drives toward the warship.\\n18 - Ext. Battleship - Day\\nWe see the chopper up close now...jeez! air-to-air missiles, heat-seekers, guns up the wazoo...the whole nine yards.\\nM.C.: What you are about to see in operation is Europe’s answer to the electronic battlefield. The first working prototype of the Tiger helicopter. Uniquely maneuverable, the Tiger not only uses stealth technology, it is the only helicopter to be hardened against all forms of electronic interference, radio jamming and electro-magnetic radiation.\\n19 - Int. Hall - Day\\nTwo pilots in blue flight suits, clutching helmets make their way outside to the chopper. They are stopped by Xenia, wearing a revealing dress. She whistles to get their attention. The pilots turn. She speaks seductively...\\nXENIA:  Shh. I have a small surprise from your friends back at the barracks.\\nOne pilot turns to the other and grins.\\nPILOT: I think I’ve gone to Heaven!\\nXENIA:  Not yet.\\nShe whips out a pistol and shoots both of them. Xenia is shown next wearing one of the blue flight suits and the helmet with the visor down.\\n20 - Ext. Landing Pad - Day\\nM.C. (O.S.): Now let’s welcome the pilots...Lt. Commander Bernard Jobert and Lt. Francois Bruse.\\nThe ‘pilots’ wave and board the helicopter. Bond is now on the warship RUNNING toward the Tiger, but he is pushed against the wall by 2 burly guards. They all watch the Tiger take off. Fade out....\\n21 - Ext. Northern Russia - Evening\\nA dog team runs through the snow near...Fade up title...\\n“Space Weapons Control Centre, Severnaya, Russia”\\nA desolate area, wind blowing snow around a building with a HUGE satellite dish on top of it.\\n22 - Int. Weapons Centre - Evening\\nA bunch of monitors, computers, electronic map of the world occupy the area. We hear a voice..\\nWOMAN (O.S.): Select MIR. Autographic projection.\\nWe pan to the right to reveal Natalya Simonova, a beautiful computer programmer, seated at a computer with postcards of a tropical beach taped to the side.\\nNATALYA: Compute possible intercept with second stage geo-set two.\\nWhatever that means. We show the monitor. Up pops a window “Enter Password” along with a graphic of a woman in a bikini. Natalya sighs and looks at a guy in a chair, playing with a pen like an idiot. Leather jacket, greasy hair, wire-rim glasses. This program was obviously designed by this dude. Natalya looks to the woman behind her.\\nNATALYA: Anna.\\nAnna looks up from her monitor and is obviously disgusted.\\nANNA: He wouldn’t know a woman if one came up and sat on his head!\\nNatalya laughs.\\nNATALYA: Bor-ris!\\nBoris is still playing with the pen.\\nNATALYA: BORIS!\\nBORIS: What?\\nShe signals to her monitor.\\nBORIS: I thought I’d post it on the Internet, no?\\nNATALYA: What’s the password?\\nBORIS: I made it easy this time. Even you should be able to break it, borsht-for-brains. Alright, alright, I’ll give you a hint. They’re right in front of you, and can open very large doors.\\nShe types in “Knockers”.\\nNATALYA: You’re such a geek.\\nWe hear an alarm. They turn to Boris’ computer.\\nBORIS: Yes! I’m in!\\nHe rolls over to his P.C. and grins.\\nNATALYA: You’ve hacked into the U.S. Department on Justice. You know what will happen if they trace it here?\\nBORIS: The Chief of Computers will call me a genius, move me to Moscow, and give me a million bucks hard currency. I think not. Besides, the Americans are slugheads, they’ll never detect me.\\nUp pops a window “Unauthorized Access Detected”.\\nNATALYA: You’re saying, slughead.\\nBORIS: Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko.\\nHe types something and up pops a window “Send Spike”.\\nBORIS: Spiked them!\\nNATALYA: Come on, Boris...\\nBORIS: No way! I spiked them!\\n“Initiate Search Program. Enter Password”.\\nNATALYA: Alright, what’s the password?\\nBORIS: I’m not going to tell you.\\nNATALYA: OK, let me guess. It’s not in front of me?\\nBoris shakes his head.\\nBORIS: You sit on it, but you can’t take it with you.\\nBoris types in 5 characters. A map pops up on-screen. A red line connects cities.\\nBORIS: My program seizes the phone line of whoever’s tracing me and jams their modem so they get hung up. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.\\nAn F.B.I. screen pops up.\\nBORIS: Whoo!\\nHe types....\\nBORIS: “Better luck next time, Slugheads!” BAM! GONE! I am invincible!!\\nBoris leaps up triumphantly with his arms in the air. Other technicians just look at him. He turns to Natalya.\\nBORIS: Was it good for you, too?\\nShe’s annoyed with him.\\nNATALYA: I’m getting some coffee.\\nShe walks away.\\nBORIS: I’m going for a cigarette.\\n23 - Ext. Facility - Evening\\nA sliding door opens and Boris outside with a parka on. Buurrr! Cold! He bites a beat-up cigarette and lights a zippo. The lighter blows out, and Boris looks up and sees... The Tiger helicopter fighting the wind, landing in the snow. The cockpit opens, Xenia and Ourumov jump out.\\n24 - Int. Severnaya Kitchen - Evening\\nNatalya is getting a cup of coffee.\\n25 - Int. Hallway - Evening\\nXenia and Ourumov walk down a hallway and stop at a little box on the wall: a voice-identification system.\\nOURUMOV:  General Akadi Gregorovich Ourumov, head of Space Division.\\nA door opens. Xenia and Ourumov enter...\\n26 - Int. Severnaya Control Room - Evening\\nA soldier hurries to address the General. He salutes.\\nMAJOR: General, if I’d known...\\nOURUMOV:  You’d have been ready. This is an unscheduled test of the Severnaya facility, Major. War simulation. We are going to test via GoldenEye. Report the status.\\nMAJOR: Two operational satellites, Sir. Petya and Mischa. Both in 90 minute Earth orbit at 100 kilometers.\\nOURUMOV:  Good.\\nHe takes out an authority card.\\nOURUMOV: Here is the authorization code. Now the GoldenEye and today’s access numbers for satellite Petya, please.\\nHe looks at his watch.\\nOURUMOV:  I am timing you.\\nThe Major scurries away, slides the card through a slot and presses his hand on an ID pad. The metal wall opens...revealing a square disk with a large golden crystal in the center: The GoldenEye. The Major takes the GoldenEye and two keys from its safe and hands them to the General.\\nOURUMOV:  Good. Thank you, Major.\\nNatalya notices something is going on from her position in the kitchen. Xenia cocks an automatic rifle and shoots every technician in the room. She is visibly enjoying herself. Natalya is still in the kitchen, scared to death. Bodies of her co-workers lay everywhere. Ourumov walks toward a large control panel and slides the GoldenEye in a slot, and\\nhands a key to Xenia. They slide the keys in...\\nOURUMOV:  On my count...3...2...1!\\nThey turn the keys at the same time. It activates the electronic map on the wall.\\nOURUMOV:  Set target. Severnaya.\\nXenia types in something. Russia lights up in red.\\nOURUMOV:  Arm the weapon.\\nShe types once again. Ourumov flips a plastic cover and twists the red dial inside.\\n27 - Space\\nA satellite in orbit breaks off its protective cover. CCCP is printed on the side.\\n28 - Int. Control Room - Evening\\nXenia types in a firing code.\\n29 - Space\\nThe satellite spreads its thrusters.\\n30 - Int. Control Room - Evening\\nAn alarm sounds “Weapon Armed”. They hear a noise, and Natalya runs back into the kitchen.\\nOURUMOV:  Check it.\\nXenia grabs her gun and runs down to a person who managed to send a distress signal. She shoots him again.\\n31 - Int. Kitchen - Evening\\nNatalya notices a vent in the ceiling. Maybe she can escape that way....\\n32 - Int. Control Room - Evening\\nOURUMOV:  Their best response time is 19 minutes. They’ll be late.\\n33 - Ext. Russian Air Base - Evening\\nThree pilots sprint to their aircrafts while an alarm sounds.\\n34 - Int. Control Room - Evening\\nXenia decides to check the kitchen. She notices some spilled coffee. She bends down and touches it, still hot. She spots the opened vent in the ceiling and fires at it. Meanwhile, Ourumov secures the GoldenEye and keys inside a briefcase. Both walk out.\\nXENIA:  It’s clean. I had to ventilate someone.\\nWe see a digital timer counting down.\\n35 - Space\\nThe satellite moves into position.\\n36 - Ext. Facility - Evening\\nXenia and the General load into the chopper and take off.\\n37 - Ext. Air base - Evening\\nThe three MiGs take off.\\n38 - Ext. MI6 building - Night\\nWe see the MI6 building as a double-decker bus passes.\\n39 - Int. Moneypenny’s office - Night\\nBond makes his way to Miss Moneypenny’s office. She’s inside wearing an elegant black dress. James loves this.\\nBOND: Good evening, Moneypenny.\\nShe looks up and sees James standing in the doorway.\\nMONEYPENNY: Good evening, James. M will meet you in the situation room. I’m to take you straight in.\\nShe walks past him. He watches.\\nBOND: I’ve never seen you after hours, Moneypenny, lovely.\\nMONEYPENNY: Thank you, James.\\nBOND: Out on some professional assignment? Dressing to kill?\\nThey start to walk down a hall.\\nMONEYPENNY: I know you’ll find this crushing, 007, but I don’t sit at home every night praying for some international incident so I can run down here all dressed up to impress James Bond. I was on a date, if you must know, with a gentleman. We went to the theater together.\\nShe presses a few buttons.\\nBOND: Moneypenny, I’m devastated. What would I ever do without you?\\nMONEYPENNY: As far as I can remember, James, you’ve never had me.\\nThe elevator stops and they step out. Bond moves in closer.\\nBOND: Hope, spring is eternal.\\nMONEYPENNY: You know, this sort of behavior could qualify as sexual harassment.\\nBOND: Really, what’s the penalty for that?\\nMONEYPENNY: Someday you have to make good on your innuendoes.\\nAnother door slides open. James keeps staring at her.\\nBOND: After you, Moneypenny.\\nMONEYPENNY: No, I insist. You first.\\nBond walks through the door into...\\n40 - Int. Situation room - Night\\nCommon “Situation Room”. Satellite photo on the wall, computers, monitors everywhere.\\nBill Tanner approaches Bond.\\nTANNER: Good Evening, Mr. Bond.\\nBOND: Tanner, What’s up?\\nTANNER: Sixteen minutes ago, we intercepted a distress call from a supposedly abandoned radar station at Severnaya. Look what the satellite picked up.\\nWe see a satellite photo on a computer monitor. Pictured is what looks like a bird’s-eye-view of a helicopter. They zoom in on the image.\\nTANNER (O.S.): We found a match. Your missing Tiger.\\nThe computer does a scan of the aircraft.\\nBOND (O.S.): In the middle of northern Russia.\\nTANNER: Seems like your hunch was right, 007. Too bad the evil queen of numbers won’t let you play it.\\nBond clears his throat, signaling that she’s right behind him. Tanner cringes, and turns around...slowly. There’s M. A woman with short gray hair, face as hard as stone and a disposition to match.\\nM: You were saying?\\nTANNER: No, I was just...uh...\\nM: Good, because if I want sarcasm, Mr. Tanner, I’ll talk to my children, thank you very much. (Pause) Good evening, 007.\\nBOND: Good evening, M.\\nM: The Prime Minister’s waiting for an update. Proceed with your briefing, Mr. Tanner.\\nTANNER: Thank you. After the distress signal, your helicopter took off, and the Russians scrambled these three MiGs here to intercept it.\\nHe walks to the satellite photo on the wall.\\nBOND (O.S.): What do you think the Russians were using the base for?\\nTANNER: Well at one point, we suspected that Severnaya might be the ground station for a secret space-based weapon system called GoldenEye, but...\\nM: Our statistical analysis saw they had neither the finance or technology to implement it.\\nBOND: Numbers were never my strong suite.\\nM just stares at him.\\nBOND: Are these pictures live?\\nTanner starts to say something when...\\nM: Unlike the American government, we prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.\\n41 - Ext. Russian sky - Night\\nThe three MiGs soar through the sky at Mach 2.\\n42 - Int. Severnaya kitchen - Night\\nWe see a cabinet door open, a pair of eyes peek out. Natalya crawls out.\\n43 - Ext. Russian sky - Night\\nThe MiGs do a fly-by of the Severnaya facility.\\nMiG Pilot: Negative, so far. Everything seems normal.\\n44 - Int. Severnaya - Night\\nNatalya stands among the bodies of her late co-workers. An alarm sounds. “Time to target...3...2...1!” Oh crap.\\n45 - Space\\nThe satellite gives off a blinding light and a pulse surges.\\n46 - Ext. Severnaya - Night\\nA surge ripples though the ground and the dish begins to short circuit.\\n47 - Int. Severnaya - Night\\nElectrical explosions fill the room, and Natalya runs and dives under a metal staircase.\\n48 - Int. MI6 Situation Room - Night\\nThe satellite picture on the wall fizzles out. Nothing but static.\\nTANNER: What the bloody hell was that?\\nM is in deep thought.\\n49 - Ext. Russian sky - Night\\nThe MiGs start to short circuit, all the controls go haywire, the pilot screams. The jet goes down, two explode in mid-air. The third is still careening toward the dish. It crashes into it and explodes.\\n50 - Int. Severnaya -Night\\nA pipe breaks right next to Natalya’s head. She leaps up from her hiding place, screaming. She trips on a body and falls. Above her, the rig holding up a bunch of TV monitors comes crashing down, and stops just before crushing her.\\n51 - Ext. Severnaya - Night\\nThe dish is still exploding....\\n52 - Int. Severnaya - Night\\nNatalya covers up Anna with a cloth. She’s crying now as she walks to the little voice ID box in the hallway.\\nNATALYA: Natalya Fiodorovna Simonova.\\nThe bars don’t move, duh, the box is obviously busted.\\nNATALYA: NATALYA FIODOROVNA SIMONOVA!!!\\nShe hears a creak above her. She looks up and walks away. The dish comes CRASHING down, through the roof! Natalya’s really scared now...but...\\n53 - Ext. Severnaya - Night\\nNatalya climbs out the newly revealed exit. From afar we see her, surrounded by fire.\\nNATALYA: Boris!? Boris!?\\n54 - Int. MI6 Situation Room - Night\\nTanner’s on the phone.\\nTANNER: Thanks.\\nHe hangs up.\\nTANNER: Our satellite’s knocked out. So are two of the Americans’. We have another coming into range...now.\\nThe satellite picture on the wall comes back on.\\nTANNER: Good God. Two of the MiGs are down...\\nThey look at a monitor.\\nM: And it looks like the third went into the dish.\\nM turns to Bond, who is still studying the wall.\\nM: What do you think?\\nBOND: No lights. Not one single electric light on a thirty-mile radius. (Pause) EMP?\\nTANNER: Would account for the MiGs and the satellite.\\nBOND: And the blackout.\\nTanner turns to M.\\nTANNER: Electro-Magnetic Pulse. First strike satellite weapon developed by the...uh..\\nM: The Americans and Soviets during the Cold War. I read the brief. Discovered after Hiroshima. Set off a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere, creates a pulse; a radiation surge that destroys everything with an electronic circuit.\\nTANNER: The idea being to knock out the enemy’s communication before he, she or they could retaliate.\\nM: So, GoldenEye exists.\\nBOND: Yes.\\nM: Could this be an accident?\\nBOND: No. The helicopter. If you wanted to steal the GoldenEye it’s the perfect getaway vehicle. Setting off the blast was the ideal way to wipe out any trace of the crime.\\nM: The Janus Group?\\nBOND: They may have been involved with the helicopter.\\nHe moves to a computer.\\nBOND: I know the Russian fail-safe systems. You just can’t walk in and ask for the keys to he bomb. You need the access codes.\\nOn the computer, James zooms in on a small white object, moving. It appears to be a person. (It’s Natalya)\\nBOND (O.S.): There had to be an insider.\\nHe looks closer at the monitor.\\nBOND: And at least one person probably knows who it is.\\n55 - Ext. Severnaya - Night\\nNatalya falls into the snow. She hears sled dogs, she runs toward them. We see a dog team.\\n56 - Int. M’s Office - Night\\nM is on the phone.\\nM: Very well, Sir. Thank you, good night.\\nShe hangs up and turns to Bond.\\nM: The Prime Minister’s talked to Moscow. They’re saying it was an accident during a routine training exercise.\\n007 is seated in a chair, hands folded neatly\\nBOND: Governments change. The lies stay the same.\\nM walks around from behind her desk.\\nM: What else do we know about the Janus Syndicate?\\nBOND: Top-flight arms dealers headquartered in St. Petersburg. First outfit to reach north the Iraqis during the Gulf War. Their head man in unreliably described, no photographs. The woman, Onatopp, is our only confirmed contact.\\nM: Would you care for a drink?\\nBOND: Um...thank you. Your predecessor kept some Cognac in the top drawer…\\nM: I prefer Bourbon.\\nShe pours the drinks.\\nM: Ice?\\nBOND: Yes.\\nShe hands a glass to him.\\nM: We pulled the files on anyone who might had access or authority at Severnaya. Top name on our list is a friend of yours, I understand...\\nShe sits at her desk and presses a button. A screen in back of her appears with Ourumov’s ugly face on it.\\nBOND: Ourumov. They made him a general.\\nM: He sees himself as the next ‘I’ man if Russia. Which is why our political analysts rule him out. He doesn’t fit the profile of a traitor.\\nBond is a little annoyed...\\nBOND: Are these the same analysts who said GoldenEye couldn’t exist, who said the helicopter posed no immediate threat, and wasn’t worth following?!\\nM: You don’t like me, Bond. You don’t like my methods. You think I’m an accountant, a bean counter, more interested in my members than your instincts.\\nBOND: The thought had occurred to me.\\nM: Good, because I think you’re a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the Cold War, whose boyish charms though wasted on me obviously appeal to the young woman I sent out to evaluate you.\\nBond takes a sip of his drink.\\nBOND: Point taken.\\nM: Not quite, 007.\\nShe’s got his attention.\\nM: If you think for one moment I don’t have the balls to send a man out to die, your instincts are dead wrong. I have no compunction about sending you to your death. But I won’t do it on a whim. Even with your cavalier attitude toward life.\\nShe leans forward on her desk...\\nM: I want you to find GoldenEye, find who took it, what they plan to do with it and stop it. And if you should come across Ourumov, guilty or not, I don’t want you running off on some kind of vendetta. Avenging Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.\\nBOND: You didn’t get him killed.\\nM: Neither did you. Don’t make it personal.\\nBOND: (mumbles) Never.\\nHe finishes his drink and gets up. He’s had enough of this...\\nM (O.S.): Bond.\\nJames turns. M smirks.\\nM: Come back alive.\\n57 - Ext. St. Petersburg square - Day\\nA band plays in a square outside The Winter Palace, the residence of the Russian Czar until 1918.\\n58 - Int. Building - Day\\nDefense Minister Dimitri Mishkin watches the band marching from a window. A serious-looking dude with a gotee. He glances at his watch, then retreats back to a table with a board of councilors seated. There’s a knock at the door. Gen. Ourumov enters and removes his hat.\\nMISHKIN: Good morning, General Ourumov.\\nOURUMOV:  Defense Minister Mishkin, Gentlemen.\\nMISHKIN: Please, deliver your report.\\nOURUMOV:  As this council is aware, 72 hours ago, a secret weapons program codename GoldenEye was detonated over Severnaya. As head of Space Division, I personally undertook the investigation. I have concluded this crime was committed by Siberian separatists, seeking to create political unrest. Incredibly the peaceful work and much needed hard currency earnings of Severnaya have been set back by several years. Therefore, I tender my resignation.\\nThe council makes some noise, shaking their heads \"Niet\" \"No\".\\nMISHKIN: It seems the council does not want your head, Akadi Gregorovich, merely your loyal assurance that there are no other GoldenEye satellites.\\nOURUMOV:  I can’t give you that assurance, Defense Minister.\\nMISHKIN: And what of the two missing Severnaya technicians?\\nOurumov freezes. Two?! Where did two come from?!\\nOURUMOV:  I was aware only of the one. Boris Grishenko.\\nMishkin glances at a paper...\\nMISHKIN: There was a girl, also, whose body was not among the dead. Natalya Fivoriva Simonova, a level-two programmer.\\nOURUMOV:  I will investigate immediately, Defense Minister.\\nMISHKIN: It would seem presumptuous, General, to blame this incident on Siberian separatists before the whereabouts of your own people are determined.\\nThe Council looks like a bunch of statues.\\nMISHKIN: Do you agree?\\nOURUMOV:  YES, Defense Minister. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.\\nMISHKIN: That will be all.\\nThe General snaps to attention and puts his hat back on, then exits.\\n59 - Int. Q Branch - Day, I think...\\nBond makes his way to Q’s test lab. The room is full of technicians working on all sorts of gadgets. Q himself wheels up in a wheelchair with a cast on his left leg.\\nBOND: Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?\\nA rocket fires from the cast, exploding in a bright flash.\\nQ: Hunting!\\nAcross the room a parachute discharges from a BMW. Q and 007 walk toward the car.\\nQ: Right! Now pay attention, 007. First, your new car. BMW. Agile five-forward gears, all points radar. Self-destruct system, and naturally, all the usual refinements.\\nAs Q talks, James opens the car door. Blue BMW Z3 Roadster convertible. James proceeds to bug the technician working on the car. He is, of course, not listening to Q.\\nQ: Now this, I’m particularly proud of: behind the headlights - Stinger missiles.\\nBond is now listening...\\nBOND: Excellent! Just the thing for unwinding after a rough day at the office.\\nQ: Need I remind you, 007, that you have a license to kill - NOT to break the traffic laws.\\nBOND: I wouldn’t think of it.\\nQ: Good! Right, let’s get on to more practical methods.\\nThey walk to a table. Bond disappears off-screen. Q picks up a belt.\\nQ: A typical leather belt. Male size 34, buckle - notch.\\nWe see Bond now, he’s playing with a laptop, not listening as usual.\\nQ: Are you finished?\\nJames quickly closes the laptop, pauses...\\nBOND: Yes.\\nQ: Good! A typical leather belt...\\nBOND: Q! I’m familiar with that device.\\nQ: Not one with a 75-foot repelling cord built into the buckle. Fire, and out shoots a pitot followed by a high tensile wire designed to support your weight.\\nBOND: I see. And what if I need additional support?\\nQ: It’s tested for one, 007.\\nBehind them, a guy in a white lab coat enters a fake phone booth. An air-bag thing inflates, trapping the guy inside. Bond and Q could care less. Q picks up an envelope Bond has been carrying with him. An x-ray of the envelope appears on a monitor. Looks like a plane ticket. British Airways.\\nQ: Flight 878 to St. Petersburg.\\nQ taps a mirrored table.\\nQ: X-ray document scanner.\\nHe takes out a ‘clickey pen’ (ya know the kind you have to click to use).\\nQ: A pen. This is a class-4 grenade. Three clicks arms the four second fuse, another three disarms it.\\nAs he talks, Q demonstrates the clicks. Bond grabs the pen and clicks it three times.\\nBOND: How long did you say the fuse was?\\nQ grabs it back, and disarms it.\\nQ: Oh, grow up 007.\\nBOND: Who said the pen was mightier than the sword?\\nQ: Thanks to me, they were right!\\nQ walks toward a test dummy while the man stuck in the telephone booth is being wheeled away.\\nQ: Look, let’s ask Fred here to demonstrate for us.\\nHe clips the pen in “Fred’s” pocket as the guy trapped in the phone booth is wheeled away.\\nQ: Here we are. Sorry about this Fred...\\nQ clicks the pen three times.\\nQ: 1...2...3!\\nHe cowers with his hands over his ears while James looks on. Fred explodes – of course - his top half scattered around the room.\\nQ: Don’t say it!\\nBOND: The writing’s on the wall?\\nQ: Along with the rest of him.\\nBond smirks. Never a dull moment.\\nQ: Now, 007 do try and...\\nQ is interrupted by a technician being launched across the room by a blast of air.\\nNothing interesting to these guys. Bond picks up a sub sandwich and begins to inspect it, looking for knives to shoot from it or something.\\nQ: Do try and return some of this equipment in pristine order...\\nQ notices what James is doing.\\nQ: Don’t touch that!\\nJames is scared as Q grabs the sub.\\nQ: That’s my lunch!\\n60 - Ext. Runway - Day\\nA British Airways jet touches down on the runway in St. Petersburg, Russia.\\n61 - Ext. Airport Exit - Day\\nBond walks from the terminal and spots the guy he’s looking for. Big dude with a stupid fur hat and a trench coat. Name’s Jack Wade, 007’s CIA counterpart. Bond approaches him and ventures at casual conversation, otherwise known as code to establish alliance.\\nBOND: In London, April’s a spring month.\\nWADE: Aw yeah? And who are you, the weatherman? And fer cryin’ out loud! Another stiff-ass Brit! Yer secret codes and yer passwords. One of these days you guys’re gonna learn to drop it. Come on, my car’s over there.\\nBond is a little annoyed. They cross the street to a little blue...um...car - box thing. Bond opens a door.\\nBOND: After you.\\nWADE: Thank you.\\nJames whips out his Walther, jamming it into Wade’s chest.\\nBOND: Like you said...Drop it!\\nWADE: Alright, in London April’s a spring month, where’s in St. Petersburg we’re freezin’ our butts off. Now is that close enough for government work?!\\nBOND: No! Show me the rose.\\nWADE: Please, no.\\nBond slams the gun harder.\\nWADE: Alright! Alright! Alright!\\nWade partially drops his pants showing a tattoo of a rose with the word ‘Muffy’ above it.\\nBOND: Muffy?\\nWADE: Third wife. Jack Wade. CIA.\\nBOND: James Bond. Stiff-ass Brit.\\nWADE: That’s a nice move...\\nBOND: Nice car.\\nWADE: Well, she hasn’t let me down yet. She’s like a little bitch, but she gets ya there. (pause) Hey Bond. Ya do any gardening?\\n62 - Ext. Train Station - Day\\nNatalya appears getting off a train, and looks behind her back like she’s being followed. She only sees two Russian soldiers.\\n63 - Ext. Plaza - Day\\nThe little blue box that Wade calls a car is sitting in the middle of a square with smoke coming from the engine (in the trunk, ya know like old VW Beetles). Wade’s trying to fix it. We move in closer...\\nWADE: Can ya hand me that wrench, Jimmy?\\nJames picks up a wrench and hands it to Wade.\\nBOND: So what do you know about Janus?\\nWADE: Zilch. No one’s ever seen him. But the man’s connected up the gazoo. KGB, military. Screwdriver.\\nJames picks up a screwdriver from the pile of tools.\\nWADE: Rumor has it, he lives on one of those old Soviet missile trains. That armored stuff they used to run around the country so we couldn’t target’em.\\nWade stands up.\\nWADE: Ya wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo?\\nBond picks up a hammer. Wait... “Jimbo”?!\\nWADE: No, the bigger one. The sledge.\\nBond picks up a sledge hammer.\\nWADE: Anyways, to tell the truth, you don’t find this guy, he finds you.\\nWade proceeds to hammer the screwdriver gently into the engine.\\nWADE: Hell, it’s all Russian Mafia...The best I can do is point you in the direction of his competition.\\nWade whacks the engine HARD with the sledge hammer, and roars to life. Bond smirks.\\nBOND: Who is the competition?\\nWADE: An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother. Got a limp on his right leg, name’s Zukovsky.\\nBOND: Valentin Dimitrovich Zukovsky?\\nWADE: Yeah! You know him?\\nBOND: I gave him the limp.\\n64 - Ext. IBM Building - Day\\nNatalya walks up to a building with the familiar IBM logo on it. She enters.\\n65 - Int. IBM Building - Day\\nShe walks inside and locates the manager in a room marked \"No Access\" carrying a CPU. She knocks on a door to get the guy’s attention. He puts the CPU down.\\nMANAGER: Yes?\\nNATALYA: Are these all you have?\\nShe looks around the room at about 10 to 15 computers.\\nMANAGER: How many do you want?\\nShe reads from a paper...\\nNATALYA: Twenty-four for the American school, eleven for the Swedish, IBM Compatible with 500 MHz drives and 34 modems.\\nMANAGER: You pay dollars?\\nNATALYA: Of course.\\nMANAGER: If ma’dam would require a demonstration...\\nNATALYA: Ma’dam requires a demonstration modem and a quiet place to test it.\\nThe manager shows her into a back room.\\n66 - Int. Boris’ computer lab - ?\\nIn an unknown location, we see a screen with Boris’ program. “Incoming E-mail”. Boris turns around wearing a sweater with the peace sign on it. Funky. He sees who the mail’s from...\\nBORIS: Natalya!\\nTypes: “I thought you were dead.”\\n67 - Int. IBM back room - Day\\nNatalya is seated at a PC. She types, evidently in an e-mail. “Ourumov killed everyone, fired ‘Petya’, took GoldenEye”. The manager bursts in the room, scaring the crap out of Natalya.\\nMANAGER: Is everything satisfactory?\\nNATALYA: Everything except the interruption.\\nHe leaves.\\n68 - Int. Boris’ computer lab - ?\\nBoris types: “You aren’t safe. Trust no-one. Meet me at Our Lady of Smolensk in one hour.”\\n69 - Int. IBM back room - Day\\nNatalya gets the message, smiles.\\n70 - Ext. Bridge - Day\\nThe little blue box Wade calls a car drives across a bridge.\\nWADE (V.O.): Lemme get this straight Jimmy...you shot him in the leg, you stole his car, you took his girl, now you want Valentin Zukovsky to set you up with Janus?\\n71 - Ext. Valentin’s club - Day\\nThe car pulls up...\\nBOND (V.O): Yes.\\nWADE (V.O.): Well, what are ya gonna do, appeal to his heart?\\nBOND (V.O.): No, his wallet.\\nWADE (V.O.): Oh, now that might work...OK, showtime!\\nThe car stops and we see Wade and Bond both stuffed inside. They see two Russians by a car.\\nWADE: Valentin operates out of Building 23, there. You sure you wanna do this? The last guy who dropped in uninvited went home Air Freight. In very small boxes.\\nBOND: Make sure they send me home First Class.\\nBond gets out of the car.\\n72 - Ext. Church - Day\\nNatalya walks up to “Our Lady of Smolnesk”, a church.\\n73 - Int. Church - Day\\nShe walks inside. Quiet. Very quiet. Extremely Romanesque, like in any other large church Orthodox church. Natalya looks up at a suspended cross. She waits, looks for Boris. She spots a suspicious-looking figure in a black cloak, praying. The heavy doors suddenly close by themselves, almost blowing out some candles. Natalya runs, totally freaked out, back down the aisle. The figure looks at her, it’s just an old woman. Around the corner she runs\\ninto Boris, she screams.\\nBORIS: Natalya! It’s me! It’s Boris, it’s Boris! Hello! Shhh...\\nXenia walks up from behind Natalya...\\n74 - Int. Valentin’s club - Day\\nValentin, a big guy with a limp, walks across his nightclub, zips up a woman’s dress. He talks to himself.\\nVALENTIN: Another morning shot to hell. The free market economy, I swear it will be the end.\\nSuddenly a gun in cocked by his head. We see it’s Bond’s Walther.\\nVALENTIN: Walther PPK, 7.65 mm, only three men I know use such a gun...I believe I’ve illed two of them...\\nWe pan to the right. Yep. Bond.\\nBOND: Lucky me.\\nAnother gun presses against James’ head.\\nVALENTIN: I think not.\\nOn a stage, a few girls attempt to sing “Stand By Your Man”. Really badly – with Russian accents, to boot! But a few men in the audience stay interested, mainly because of the skimpy costumes. Bond is being ‘escorted’ by two henchmen. They throw him on a couch. Valentin sits on a chair in front of him.\\nVALENTIN: James Bond. Charming, sophisticated, secret agent. Shaken, but not stirred...\\nThe Russians laugh...\\nBOND: I see you haven’t lost your delicate sense of humor, Valentin. Or your need for an audience. Who’s strangling the cat?\\nI couldn’t have put it better myself. Valentin looks quizzically where Bond is gazing.\\nVALENTIN: Strangling a cat?!\\nWe see the lead singer practically howling ‘Stand by your mahn!!’. Valentin whips out a gun and shoots the couch right between James’ legs...\\nVALENTIN: It’s Irina. My mistress.\\nBond looks like he just swallowed his words.\\nBOND: Very talented girl...\\nVALENTIN: Irina!! Take a hike!!!\\nIrina shuts up right before giving him an “up yours” with her arms.\\nVALENTIN: So, Mr. Bond; what is it that brings you to my neighborhood? Still working for MI6, or have you decided to join the 21st century? I hear the new M is a lady...\\nBOND: I want you to do me a favor.\\nThe big Russian laughs.\\nVALENTIN: He wants me to do HIM a favor!! My knee aches every single day, twice as bad when it is cold. Do you have any idea how long the winter lasts in this country? Tell him Dimitri...\\nDIMITRI (O.S.): Well, it depends...\\nVALENTIN: Silence!!!!\\nBOND: For an ex-KGB agent, you surprise me Valentin. Surely someone of your stature must have realized the skill was not to hit your knee, but to...uh...miss the rest of you.\\nVALENTIN: So why did you not kill me?\\nBOND: Call it professional courtesy.\\nVALENTIN: Then I should extend you the same courtesy...\\nValentin shoots to Bond’s right leg, miss. Left leg, miss again. Valentin aims in between...\\nBOND: Kerov’s Funeral Parlor, 4 o’clock this afternoon!\\nHe’s got his attention...\\n75 - Int. Valentin’s office - Day\\nBond is seated, Valentin’s getting a drink.\\nBOND: Two hundred pounds of C4 explosives hidden in a casket. Your man drives the hearse in. The money’s  exchanged. Their man drives the hearse out. Their man will be arrested with the explosives. Your man will make a miraculous escape with the money. Your money.\\nValentin sits at his desk.\\nVALENTIN: And what do I owe for this accommodation?\\nBOND: I want you to set me up. With Janus.\\nVALENTIN: And what has he done to deserve you?\\nBOND: Stole a helicopter.\\nVALENTIN: I have six.\\nBOND: Three. None that fly.\\nVALENTIN: Who’s counting?\\nBOND: These aren’t criminals Valentin, they’re traitors. They used the chopper to steal a nuclear weapon, killed a lot of innocent Russians doing it.\\nVALENTIN: What do you expect from a Cossack?\\nBOND: Who?\\nVALENTIN: This Janus. I’ve never met the man, but I know he’s a Lienz Cossack.\\nBOND: Grouped that worked for the Nazis against the Russians, second World War.\\nVALENTIN: You know your history, Mr. Bond. At the end of the war, the Lienz Cossacks surrendered to the British in Austria, believing they would join your government and wage war against the Communists. But the British betrayed them. Sent them back to Stalin who promptly had them all shot. Women, children, families.\\nBOND: Not exactly our finest hour.\\nVALENTIN: Still, ruthless people. They got what they deserved.\\nBOND: I want you to set me up with Janus. Tell him I’m asking about the chopper and\\nmeet me tonight at the Grand Hotel Europe.\\nVALENTIN: Then you and I are even and he owes me one.\\nBOND: Precisely.\\n76 - Ext. Grand Hotel Europe - Night\\nBond’s elegant hotel...\\n77 - Int. Pool Area - Night\\nA shadow moving through the pool water. James surfaces right in front of the camera, then pushes off the side of the cement pool floating on his back. Nice pool, circular, with huge pillars surrounding it...we see a door open and someone walks in, circling the pool. James is still floating peacefully when he notices someone’s watching him. Wait! Isn’t that...?! He climbs out of the pool. He grabs a towel and dabs his face. Then he grabs his Walther. James pulls the person by the arm, pulling them into a steam room. He aims the gun at...Xenia. Wearing only a loosefitting robe. James is a little interested. His chiseled body is still soaked, hair slicked back...looking sexy...\\nXENIA:  You don’t need the gun, Commander.\\nBOND: That depends on your definition of safe sex.\\nShe comes at him, really close. His only weakness...\\nBOND: That’s close enough.\\nXENIA:  Not for what I have in mind.\\nThey kiss. James tosses the gun on a massage table. She pulls away, with his lower lip clenched in her teeth. Bond flinches and pushes her to the wall. He touches his lip, a little blood, but enough to get him pissed off. He goes for the gun...Xenia kicks him to the ground before he can get it. She jumps on top of him, he rolls on top of her...\\nXENIA:  You think you can hurt me?\\nJames gets off of her, and goes for the gun again. Xenia pushes him onto the massage table, and jumps on him. Normally, Bond would love this - but she’s crushing his rib cage. He gasps, and tries to pry her legs off his torso. He gets up, with Xenia still hanging on with her legs, and slams her against the wall.\\nXENIA:  You think you can break me?\\nThey kiss again wildly...She squeezes harder, Bond’s eyes pop open and he runs slamming Xenia into another wall. Now she’s screaming...he sits her on the steam grate. Another guy has heard the screaming and Bond swiftly knocks him out. He flips Xenia over his shoulder, finally off of him. Now he gets the gun and aims it at her.\\nBOND: No, no, no. No more foreplay.\\nHe cocks the gun.\\nBOND: Take me to Janus.\\nXENIA:  (Russian) Bastard!!\\n78 - Ext. Statue Junk yard - Night\\nA gray Mercedes pulls up at a junk yard littered not with garbage, but with hundreds of old stone statues. From before the fall of the Iron Curtain. VERY eerie.\\n79 - Int. Mercedes - Night\\nXenia’s at the wheel, Bond is in back covered in shadow pointing a gun at Xenia.\\nBOND: This is it?\\nXENIA:  Yes.\\nHe leans forward, puts the gun away.\\nBOND: Well, I must say, I’ve had a lovely evening. You?\\nXENIA:  Once again, the pleasure was all yours.\\nBOND: You’ll understand if I don’t call...\\nXENIA:  I won’t loose sleep over it.\\nHe suddenly whacks her in the back of the head, knocking her out.\\nBOND: Sweet dreams.\\n80 - Ext. Junk yard - Night\\n007 steps out of the car, and spots the Tiger helicopter. He draws his gun. This place in very freaky, folks. Plus it’s dark, and Bond’s eyes start to play tricks on him. He aims the gun at someone...no. A statue.\\nVOICE (O.S.): Hello, James.\\nBond whips the gun around at the voice. Sounds familiar...A dark shadow walks out from what’s left of a building. 006 steps into the light. His face is badly scarred on the right side. Bond stands there, frozen in place...\\nBOND: (Softly) Alec...?\\nALEC: Back from the dead. No longer than just an anonymous star on the memorial wall at MI6.\\nBond is still frozen, his blue eyes wide.\\nALEC: What’s the matter, James? No glib remark? No pithy comeback?\\nBOND: (Softly) Why...?\\nAlec laughs.\\nALEC: Hilarious question. Particularly from you. Would you ever ask why? Why we toppled all those dictators, undermined all those regimes? Only to come home ‘Well done! Good job, but sorry ol’ boy! Everything you’ve risked your life and limb for has changed!’\\nBOND: It was the job we were chosen for.\\nALEC: Of course you’d say that. James Bond, Her Majesty’s loyal terrier. ‘Defender of the so-called Faith’.\\n007’s had enough, he raises his gun.\\nALEC: Oh, please James. Put it away. It’s insulting to think I haven’t anticipated your every move.\\nBond relaxes his arm.\\nBOND: Yes...I trusted you, Alec.\\nALEC: Trust. What a quaint idea.\\nBOND: How did the MI6 screening miss that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?\\nALEC: Once again your faith was misplaced. They knew. We’re both orphans, James. While your parents had the luxury of dying in a climbing accident, mine survived the British betrayal and Stalin’s execution squads. But my father couldn’t let himself or my mother live with the shame of it. MI6 figured I was too young to remember. And one of life’s little ironies, their son goes to work for the government who caused a father to kill himself and his wife.\\nBOND: Hence, Janus. Two-faced Roman god come to life\\nALEC: It wasn’t God who gave me this face...It was you! Setting the timers to three minutes instead of six.\\nBOND: Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?\\nALEC: No. You were suppose to die for me. And by the way, I did think of asking you to join my little scheme, but somehow I knew 007’s loyalty was always to the mission, never to his friend. (Pause) Closing time, James. Last call!\\nBond goes to raise his gun, but a quick shot is fired. A tranquilizer hits his neck, and Bond collapses. We see a sniper in the background reveal his position. Alec stands over James.\\nALEC: For England, James.\\n81 - Int. Tiger Cockpit - Night\\nJames wakes up and finds himself inside the cockpit of the helicopter. There’s someone behind him...it’s Natalya SCREECHING...\\nNATALYA (O.S.): WAKE UP!! MISTER! AHHHH! WAKE UP, PLEASE!!! WAKE UP!!!\\nBond is totally awake now. Gee.\\nBOND: I’m here, I’M HERE!!\\nNATALYA (O.S.): Hurry! Hurry up! Come on! Pull yourself together, or we’re gonna die!\\nThere’s a screen in front of him “Time to Launch”. Bond attempts to free himself, but his hands are tied to tightly.\\nNATALYA: Do something! You’ve got to get us out of here!!\\nBond is still struggling...\\nBOND: I’m...a little...tied up! Nevermind...\\n“Time to Launch :19” He tries to hit the controls with his head. The rotor is starting to turn now...”Launch :00” Bond eyes the chopper’s heat-seekers deploy. Oh, crap. Two of them fire and trail back at them. Bond looks for the EJECT button...there it is! He tries to hit it with his head. Once...twice...third time’s a charm! The rotors fly off and the entire cockpit ejects in the nick of time. The helicopter explodes, the parachute discharges, and they land safely on the ground. Bond finally gets the ropes untied, and he hops out of the cockpit.\\nBOND: The things we do for frequent-flyer mileage...\\nHe opens the canopy for Natalya.\\nBOND: Here, let me help you...that’s it...mind your head...\\nHe helps her out. She kicks him in the shin. She starts to run away, but 007 grabs arm and tries to calm her down as headlights shine on them. Soldiers pop out of the trucks aiming their weapons. Natalya finally stops struggling.\\n82 - Ext. Square - Night/early morning\\nJames and Natalya are escorted to a building which could be anything from a jail to a government office.\\n83 - Int. Interrogation Room - Early morning\\nJames and Natalya walk into a interrogation room handcuffed together. The sun is just starting to come up. Not much in here, just a barren brick room. A guard removes the cuffs and exits, the large metal door slamming behind him. Bond looks to Natalya, who backs away to the wall.\\nBOND: Who are you?\\nNo answer. He walks toward her.\\nBOND: Listen, I’m on your side. I’m here to help.\\nNATALYA: I don’t know anything.\\nBOND: I don’t believe you.\\nNATALYA: I don’t care what you believe...\\nBOND: Look, they might be back for us any minute. You either take your chances with me or your fellow countrymen who killed everyone at Severnaya. Bond is in her face, being a tough guy. Natalya pulls away from him.\\nNATALYA: I’ve never been to Severnaya.\\nBond grabs her arm and looks at her watch.\\nBOND: Your watch has. Frozen by the GoldenEye blast. And I’m willing to bet you’re the one who climbed out the dish to get out.\\nNATALYA: Who are you?\\nBOND: I work for the British government. The more you tell me, the more I can help you.\\nNATALYA: I said I don’t know anything!!\\nBOND: Then let’s start with what you do know.\\nShe sits on the table in the middle of the room. She might as well tell him.\\nNATALYA: My name is Natalya Simonova. I was a systems programmer at the Severnaya facility.\\nBOND: Go on...\\nNATALYA: Until they killed everyone.\\nBOND: Who? Alec Trevelyan?\\nNATALYA: No. I don’t know who that is.\\nBOND: Who’s the insider, who’s the traitor?\\nNATALYA: Boris. Boris Grishenko.\\nBOND: KGB or military?\\nNATALYA: Computer programmer.\\nBOND: There was no one else?\\nNATALYA: No. They’re going to kill me, aren’t they?\\nBOND: Trust me.\\nNATALYA: Trust you. I don’t even know your name.\\nThe door clicks open and the Defense Minister enters, wearing a fedora hat.\\nMISHKIN: Good morning, Mr. Bond. Sit.\\nHe walks around the table and sits down. James and Natalya do too.\\nMISHKIN: I’m Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin. By what means shall we execute you Commander Bond?\\nBOND: What, no small talk? No...chit-chat? That’s the trouble with the world today; no-one takes the time to do a really sinister interrogation anymore. It’s a lost art.\\nMISHKIN: Your sense of humor doesn’t slay me, Commander, I’m sorry. Where is the GoldenEye.\\nBOND: I assumed you had it.\\nMISHKIN: I have an English spy, a Severnaya programmer, a helicopter stolen...\\nBOND: At least that’s what some traitor in your government wanted it to look like...\\nMISHKIN: Who was behind your attack on Severnaya...?\\nBOND: Who had the authorization codes...?\\nMISHKIN: Russia may have...the penalty for terrorists is death...\\nBOND: And what’s the penalty for treason...?\\nNATALYA: Oh, stop it! Both of you! Stop it. You’re like...boys with toys. [Silence.] It was Ourumov. General Ourumov set off the weapon. I saw him do it.\\nBond turns his head slowly toward Natalya. Mishkin is pleased.\\nMISHKIN: Are you certain it was Ourumov?\\nNATALYA: Yes. He killed everyone and stole the GoldenEye.\\nMISHKIN: And why would he do that?\\nNATALYA: There is another satellite.\\nMISHKIN: Another GoldenEye. Thank you, Miss Simonova. You were saying something about the lost art of interrogation, Mr. Bond?\\nOurumov barges in the room, visibly enraged.\\nOURUMOV:  Defense Minister! I must protest! This’s my investigation! You’re out of order!\\nMISHKIN: (Russian) Idle praddle. (English) From what I’m hearing, it is YOU who is out of order!\\nOurumov picks up the PPK...\\nOURUMOV:  I’ve seen this gun before...\\nMISHKIN: Put it down General! Put it down!\\nOURUMOV:  Do you even know who the enemy is? DO YOU!\\nMISHKIN: Guards!!\\nOurumov quickly shoots a guard as well as Mishkin. Bond hits the deck, pulling Natalya with him. He slides out the clip, takes the bullets, slips the empty clip back into the gun. He thinks aloud...\\nOURUMOV:  Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin murdered by British agent James Bond.\\nHe tosses the gun to 007.\\nOURUMOV:  Who was shot while trying to escape...GUARD!\\nBond, who’s still on the ground, pushes a chair underneath the General, knocking him over. Then Bond punches him and runs him into a metal pipe. A soldier comes in the room, Bond beats him up and grabs his weapon, then pulls Natalya out the door with him.\\nBOND: Come on!\\n84 - Int. Hallway - Morning\\nBoth of them run out the door and up some stairs, Bond shooting soldiers as they run, sliding on the floor, the whole bit. To his right, left, more are coming. They flee through another door.\\n85 - Int. Archive Hall - Morning\\nThe pair run through a room on the second floor. Shelves full of boxes and old paper occupy the room. More soldiers are coming. Bond pushes a bookcase over, creating a domino effect we’ve seen in cartoons.\\nOURUMOV:  They’re in the archives!\\nThe falling bookcases barricade a door shut, cutting off Ourumov and company.\\nOURUMOV:  NO!\\nThey take an alternate route. Bond and Natalya look out a window at a lot filled with trucks and...tanks. They run. Soldiers burst through another door. Natalya is hiding behind a shelf when a few books fall over. The General knows their location now...The Russians are on the first floor, and they hear Bond running above them. The soldiers fire,\\nBond fires back, running in front of Natalya. Bond and Natalya stop…\\nOURUMOV (O.S): Spread out! Cover the other side!\\n… and he removes the belt Q gave him. He smirks.\\nBOND: Trust me.\\nThey stand up and run, but Natalya crashes through some loose grating right into Ourumov’s arms. Bond fires the belt. He swings across the room, kicks over a soldier and crashes through a window into the back of a truck.\\n86 - Ext. Back Lot - Morning\\nJames jumps down from the truck and hides beside a tank.\\nBond’s P.O.V. - Natalya being carried off by Ourumov. They get in a car.\\nOURUMOV:  Go! Now!\\nIt drives away but two more truck-fulls of Russian soldiers enter the lot. Bond eyes a tank. Number 343.\\n87 - Ext. Streets of St. Petersburg - Morning\\nOurumov’s car speeds away, but then a TANK crashes through a solid brick wall. We see Bond poke his head out.\\nOURUMOV:  Faster!\\nThe tank is close behind the car, cutting turns a little too closely. Ourumov’s car is slowed by traffic.\\nOURUMOV:  Damn! Go down the alley!\\nThe car peels out through a narrow alley. Tight squeeze...007 notices this too and ducks below. He follows creating a MUCH larger alley. Ourumov takes a swig of his liquor flask. The two jeeps following the tank fly off into the water, exploding.\\nOURUMOV:  Use the bumper! That’s what it’s for!\\nSo the driver continues, hitting all the bystanders crossing the street. Bond takes a corner, but there are two jeeps in his way. He stops the tank.\\nSOLDIER: (Russian) Back up!\\nThey do. Bond moves forward. The soldiers fire and 007 ducks below again. A 13-car pile-up clogs the road, but not if you’re in a tank. Bond runs right over it. The tank catches up with the car in a square with a statue in the middle. Both vehicles run over anything in their path: traffic. Bond crashes through a truck with boxes of Perrier on it, and then a statue of a man riding a winged horse. The bronze portion in now riding on top of the tank.\\nOURUMOV:  Go left!\\nThey do. An archway looks a little low...the statue gets caught in it for a second, hangs there, then drops on two persuing police cars, the statue riding between them. Bond abruptly halts the tank and the cars collide with the backside of the tank. Bond looks back at the damage, coolly straightens his tie and continues. Meanwhile, Ourumov’s car comes screeching to a halt near a black armored train, red star on the side.\\nOURUMOV:  Get out!\\nHe pulls Natalya out. Xenia jumps down from the train. Ourumov pushes Natalya aboard. Bond is just pulling up, he’s watching now and we can see in his eyes that he’s got an idea... The tank continues. The train lurches forward.\\n88 - Int. Train - Morning\\nInside the train, Ourumov brings Natalya into a car with elegant furnishings. Alec is eating breakfast with an expensive silver tea set. He dabs his mouth with a napkin. Xenia sits behind him.\\nALEC: You brought me the perfect gift, General Ourumov. You’ve made me a very unhappy man.\\nOURUMOV:  Mishkin got to him before I could.\\nALEC: Bond is alive?\\nOurumov takes out his flask again.\\nOURUMOV:  He escaped.\\nALEC: Good for Bond. Bad for you.\\nHe eyes Natalya and attempts to be a gentleman.\\nALEC: Take a seat, my dear.\\nShe does. He walks behind her and kneels down.\\nALEC: You know, James and I shared everything. Absolutely everything...\\nHe pulls back her hair from her face.\\nALEC: To the victor go the spoils.\\n89 - Ext. Tracks - Morning\\nThe train travels down the tracks and Bond’s tank pulls up in a tunnel.\\n90 - Int. Train - Morning\\nAlec tries to kiss Natalya, she resists.\\nALEC: You’ll like it where we’re going...\\n91 - Ext. Tracks - Morning\\nBond’s tank is still sitting there. The driver of the train notices the obstruction.\\n92 - Int. Train - Morning\\nAlec kisses Natalya.\\nALEC: You may even learn to like me...\\nHe kisses her again, full on the lips this time. She squirms...and slaps him\\nNATALYA: (Russian) Bastard!\\nAn alarm sounds.\\nALEC: (To Ourumov) Stay with her.\\nAlec and Xenia run to a monitor showing Bond’s tank parked in the tunnel.\\nALEC: Bond. Only Bond.\\nXENIA:  He’s going to derail us...\\nAlec talks to the conductor with a radio.\\nALEC: Full speed!\\nConductor: (Russian) What?\\nALEC: Full speed!! Ram him!\\nXenia’s grinning, the conductor sounds a whistle. Alec and Xenia brace themselves for a collision.\\n93 - Ext. Tracks - Morning\\nThe train speeds forward toward the tank. Bond fires the main gun, making the train into a speeding fireball. James jumps from the tank crouches in the brush. The train and tank collide, stopping the train in its tracks.\\n94 - Int. Train - Morning\\nIt looks like an earthquake hit in here. Natalya recovers from the shock and runs for the door. Ourumov grabs her.\\nXenia and Alec are still on the floor. Alec comes to and tries to pounce on a gun. A foot pins it to the ground. It’s Bond. Pointing a machine gun at 006. Alec lies on the ground.\\nALEC: Why can’t you just be a good boy and die?\\nBOND: You first. (To Xenia) You, second. UP!\\nBoth stand up.\\nALEC: Situation analysis: hopeless. You have no back-up, no escape route. And I have the only bargaining chip.\\nBOND: Where is she?\\nALEC: Ah, yes. Your fatal weakness. (into a radio) Ourumov, bring her in. (to Bond) Lovely girl. Tastes like...strawberries.\\nBOND: I wouldn’t know...\\nALEC: I would.\\nXenia is licking her leather-clad fingers. Bond hears Ourumov bring Natalya into the room behind him. With a gun pointed to her head I might add.\\nALEC: So, we’re back to where we started, James. The friend or the mission? Drop the gun, I let her live.\\nBOND: Ourumov, what has this Cossack promised you?\\nOurumov is listening...\\nBOND: You knew, didn’t you? He’s a Lienz Cossack.\\nALEC: It’s in the past...\\nBOND: He’ll betray you! Just like everyone else.\\nOURUMOV:  Is this true?\\nALEC: What’s true is that in 48 hours you and I will have more money than God. And Mr. Bond here will have a small memorial service, with only Moneypenny and a few tearful restitures in attendance. So, what’s the choice, James? Two targets, time enough for only one shot. The girl or the mission?\\nBOND: Kill her. She means nothing to me.\\nALEC: See you in Hell, James.\\nBond makes his move. He spins around and shoots Ourumov, then turns and shoots at Alec, but he got away. Armor clicks into place around the doors and windows. Bond runs to every door, and checks the roof.\\nBOND: One-inch armor plating.\\nNATALYA: I’m fine, thank you very much.\\nShe sits at a computer. Bond is still fiddling with the roof.\\nNATALYA: Boris! Yes!\\nBond brings his arms down.\\nBond:What are you doing?\\nNATALYA: Boris is online backing up his files. If I can spike him, I may be able to find out where they’re going.\\nBond has NO idea what all that means.\\nBOND: Oh.\\nNATALYA: Well, don’t just stand there! Get us out of here!\\nBOND: Yes, sir.\\n95 - Ext. Train - Morning\\nThe top of the train retracts to reveal a little Robinson helicopter.\\n96 - Int. Train - Morning\\nBond is pulling up carpet, trying to find a place to cut through.\\n97 - Int. Robinson - Morning\\nAlec and Xenia are seated in the chopper.\\n98 - Int. Train - Morning\\nWe see the screen with Boris’ program. An intercom sounds.\\nALEC (V.O.): Good luck with the floor, James. I set the timers for six minutes. The same six minutes you gave me.\\n99 - Int. Robinson - Morning\\nALEC: It was the least I could do for a friend.\\nHe laughs, really sinister folks...\\n100 - Int. Train - Morning\\nNATALYA: What does that mean?\\nBOND: We’ve got three minutes.\\nHe takes off his watch.\\n101 - Ext. Train - Morning\\nThe little chopper flies away.\\n102 - Int. Boris’ Unknown Location - Who knows???\\nBoris is seated at a computer, twirling a pen around his fingers.\\n103 - Int. Train - Morning\\nNatalya is sending a SPIKE. “Spike Sent”\\n104 - Int. Boris’ Location - ?????\\nBoris notices the problem, and he freezes.\\n105 - Int. Train - Morning\\nBond is burning through the floor with the laser from his watch. Natalya is trying to figure out Boris’ password... “butt’...no. “Arse”...no. “Buns”...no. “Rear”...no!\\nNATALYA: What else do you call your butt?\\nBOND: What?!\\nNATALYA: It’s Boris’ password, he plays word games. It’s what I sit on, but I can’t take it with me...\\nBOND: Chair.\\nNATALYA: Like I said...\\nShe tries it...BINGO! “Starting Search”\\nBOND (O.S.): Thirty seconds...\\nA map pops up. A red line etches cities together.\\nNATALYA (O.S.): He’s not in Russia, Germany, Paris, London, Madrid...\\nBOND (O.S.): Twenty-five seconds...\\nNATALYA (O.S.): New York, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco...\\nBOND: Twenty seconds...!\\nBond jumps on the floor, trying to break it.\\nNATALYA: Mexico City, Rio, Miami...\\n106 - Int. Boris’ Location - ????\\nBoris opens a large CPU and rips the circuit boards out, in an attempt to cut the tracer.\\n107 - Int. Train - Morning\\nBond finally kicked the floor in. He grabs her arm.\\nBOND: Come on!\\nNATALYA: Wait! He’s in Cuba! Havana, no...\\n“Disconnected Search Program”\\nBOND: NOW!\\nHe pulls her away and they both jump down the hole in the floor.\\n108 - Ext. Train - Morning\\nThey roll out from under the train and sprint away from the ticking bomb. The train explodes and they fall to the ground. They sit up and watch the burning train. Natalya turns to Bond.\\nNATALYA: Do you destroy every vehicle you get into?\\nBOND: Standard operating procedure. Boys with toys!\\nNATALYA: Hmmm. Maybe I should take care of our transportation for our trip to Cuba.\\nBond puts his watch back on. Wait...\\nBOND: Our trip...?\\nNATALYA: You know how to disarm the weapon?\\nBOND: Well, I suppose that depends on what kind of weapon you’re talking about disarming...\\nShe smiles and moves in closer...\\nNATALYA: Tell me, are there any other standard operating procedures I should be aware of, Commander?\\nBOND: Thousands...but I only pay them...\\nThey kiss.\\nBOND: Lip service.\\nThey kiss again. We fade into...\\n109 - Ext. Tropical Road - Day\\nA beautiful beach. Obviously somewhere in the Carribean. Some island near Cuba. Palm trees and all. Sweet! We pan over to the right, as the blue BMW convertible vvrooms down a dirt road. Bond’s driving...nice sunglasses...Natalya is in a flowered dress. She grins. He grins back.\\nNATALYA: My whole life I’ve dreamed of coming to the Carribean. It’s so beautiful. Not another human being in sight.\\nAn alarm sounds in the car. A blue screen - a GPS tracking system - pops up. There’s something behind them...Natalya looks up. A Cessna touches down on the road, right in front of the BMW.\\nNATALYA: What is it with you and moving vehicles?!!\\nThe plane stops, and the BMW screeches to a halt. Wade hops out with a loud Hawaiian shirt on. He’s holding a bag. Bond and Natalya get out of the car.\\nWADE: Yo! Jimbo! Brought a little gift from ol’ whats-his-name - T? Z?\\nBOND: Q.\\nBond looks in the bag.\\nBOND: What are you doing here, Wade?\\nWade is looking at some of the trees.\\nWADE: Banion trees... Why, I’m not here. The CIA has no knowledge, no involvement. Absolutely nothin’ to do with your insertion into Cuba, if ya catch my drift.\\nBond slips his shades into his shirt pocket.\\nBOND: Yes I do, perfectly.\\nWADE: Borrowed the plane from a friend o’ mine in the DEA. Now the Coast Guard and the FAA are both in the loop. You’re cleared on our radar til 06.00 hours.\\nWade picks up a piece of paper in the plane.\\nWADE: Here’s the latest SAT CAM from Langley. Stay below 600 feet.\\nNatalya studies the paper.\\nNATALYA: Five hundred feet.\\nWADE: Who’s that?\\nBOND: Natalya Simonova.\\nHe pronounces it wrong.\\nNATALYA: Natalya Simonova.\\nBOND: Russian Minister of Transportation.\\nWade signals with his staw hat for Bond to talk with him ‘privately’. They move a few inches.\\nWADE: Did you check her out?\\nBond gets that look in his eye...\\nBOND: Head-to-toe.\\nWade grins.\\nWADE: Right...So yer lookin’ fer a dish the size of a football field, huh? Doesn’t exist. Ya can’t light a cigar in Cuba without us seein’ it!\\nNATALYA: I know it’s there. It’s a duplicate of Severnaya, like you secret transmitters in New Zealand.\\nWADE: I’ve never been to New Zealand. (to Bond) How’s she know ‘bout that?!\\nBOND: What if I need back-up?\\nWADE: Get on the radio. I’ll send in the Marines! Anyway hang a left at the end of the runway, Cuba’s seven miles on yer right.\\nWade walks up to the BMW.\\nBOND: Yo, Wade.\\nBond tosses the keys to Wade. He catches them in his hat.\\nBOND: Just one thing...\\nWade hops in.\\nWADE: Yeah?\\nBOND: Don’t push any of the buttons on that car.\\nWADE: I’m just gonna go bombin’ around in it!\\nBOND: Exactly.\\nWADE: Yo James. I got faith. But be careful. He knows yer comin’.\\nWade speeds away. Bond and Natalya are left with the plane.\\n110 - Ext. Beach - Evening\\nJames is sitting on a beach outside their beach-house, deep in thought. Natalya approaches him wearing a white bikini. For once, our 007 doesn’t seem to care... Somethin’s wrong. She sits beside him.\\nNATALYA: He was your friend...Trevelyan?\\nJames glances at her. No answer.\\nNATALYA: And now he’s your enemy and you will kill him. It is that simple.\\nBOND: In a word...yes.\\nNATALYA: Unless he kills you first.\\nBOND: Natalya...\\nNATALYA: You think I’m impressed?! All of you! Your guns, your killing, your death...for what?! So you can be a hero? All the heroes I know are dead.\\nBOND: Natalya, listen to me...\\nNATALYA: How can you act like this? How can you be so cold?\\nBOND: It’s what keeps me alive.\\nNATALYA: No. It’s what keeps you alone.\\nShe starts to get up but he pulls her back down to a kiss. She pulls away, but then kisses him, harder. We fade up on...\\n111 - Int. Bedroom - Night\\nA fire burns brightly as we fade up. It’s the bedroom of the place they’re staying. We pan to the right and reveal James sleeping peacefully on the bed. Shirt off. Probably more, but we can’t see. A voice...\\nNATALYA (O.S.): James?\\nHis blue eyes open. Barely above a whisper...\\nBOND: Yes?\\nNatalya appears from beside him on the bed, wrapped among the sheets. She rolls on top of him.\\nNATALYA: On the train, when you told them to kill me - and that I meant nothing to\\nyou...did you mean it?\\nThey stroke each other’s hair. He smiles...slowly.\\nBOND: Yes.\\nNatalya looks at him weird...\\nBOND: Basic rule. Always call their bluff.\\nNatalya takes a pillow and playfully smothers him with it. Bond’s laughing...they grin and kiss again passionately.\\n112 - Ext. Cuban sky - Day\\nThe little plane soars over blue water and up a cliff with dense vegetation.\\n113 - Int. Plane - Day\\nJames and Natalya, both dressed in camouflage green, sit in the cockpit. Natalya has a flight map in front of her, and is telling James where to fly.\\nNATALYA: Turn ten degrees south, bearing 184.\\nBOND: Yes, sir.\\nShe laughs. They fly over a crystal blue lake.\\nNATALYA: Nothing. There is nothing here.\\nBOND: Let’s make another pass.\\nThey do. Bond looks out.\\nBOND: Maybe Wade was right, maybe there is no dish.\\nA ground-to-air missile fires from the water and hits the wing of the Cessna. They’re going down...Bond tries to land in the water, a little off...they’re gonna crash into forest! He pulls both their heads down below the windshield, brace yourselves, folks...make sure your seats and tray-tables are in the upright and locked position...the little plane skids off the surface of the lake and hits the trees, breaking what’s left of the wings off. It finally slows to a halt.\\n114 - Ext. Rainforest - Day\\nWe see Bond’s arm poke out of the broken windshield. They’re alive, a bit shaken...not stirred -- sorry, I had to! Natalya appears to be knocked out. Bond kicks the door open. He carries her -- well, more accurately, he drags her -- out into the open. Yep, she’s quite unconscious. He drops her to the ground and collapses on top of her.\\nBOND: Natalya...?\\nNo answer. Duh. He rolls off her, lays on his back and passes out. Time passes, we fade up on Bond’s closed eyes. Then they open, groggily, to see a superimposed Scorpion helicopter. A rope drops from the chopper. Bond attempts to get up, still dazed. We see a person slide down the rope. Bond’s on his feet, still out of it, he stares up at the person. It’s Xenia, who else? Xenia’s P.O.V. - Knocks Bond to the ground.\\nShe kicks him again, then pulls him by the collar.\\nXENIA:  This time, Mr. Bond, the pleasure will be all mine.\\nShe licks his face as she crushes his ribs again. Bond struggles, in pain. Natalya has woken up...She tries to whack Xenia with a big stick, but Xenia’s too quick. She knocks it to the ground, and grabs Natalya by the face.\\nXENIA:  Wait for your turn!\\nShe bangs Natalya with her forehead, knocking her out. Bond has recovered, and he clips the rope to Xenia’s harness and uses her machine gun to shoot down the chopper pilot.The helicopter goes down, yanking the rope, and Xenia, along with it. She is pulled through the air, screaming, and slammed against a tree. She struggles for a few seconds, but falls silent. The chopper explodes in a bright flash, and our heroes duck to the ground. Bond looks at Xenia, dangling from the tree.\\nBOND: She always did enjoy a good squeeze.\\n115 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nWe cut to inside a large control room, its location still unknown. Trevelyan walks down the stairs, dressed in black. He walks through a glass door to where Boris is sitting at a station of computers.\\nALEC: Is the satellite in range?\\nBORIS: Six minutes.\\nALEC: Prepare the dish.\\nBORIS: No it is too early! I am not ready.\\nALEC: Do it!!\\nAlec walks away. Fine. If he wants it now, he’ll get it now.\\n116 - Ext. Rainforest - Day\\nBond and Natalya push on through a dense jungle. They see a large satellite dish rising from the water. Like the one in Severnaya.\\nBOND: No wonder we couldn’t see it.\\nThe dish is still rising.\\nBOND: Come on.\\nWe cut to a full view of the dish, then we see James and Natalya running toward it.\\n117 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nAlec opens the protective case and pulls the GoldenEye out. He faces Boris.\\nALEC: The world’s greatest cash card.\\nTrevelyan hands it to an eager Boris, but doesn’t take his hands off the GoldenEye.\\nALEC: It had better not be rejected.\\nBoris grabs it and slips it into the slot.\\n118 - Ext. Dish - Day\\nThe lake water drains now and reveals the “dish” part of the satellite. Bond glances at Natalya.\\n119 - Ext. Outer space\\nWe see the GoldenEye satellite in orbit.\\n120 - Ext. Rainforest - Day\\nBond walks closer to the camera, watching...the water keeps draining.\\n121 - Ext. Road - Day\\nBond and Natalya run along a road, closer to the dish.\\n122 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nBoris is playing with a pen. He glances at a monitor.\\nBORIS: Mischa is online.\\nA soldier approaches Alec and hands him a hand-held video screen. Alec looks at it. We see live footage of Bond and Natalya climbing down closer to the dish.\\nSOLDIER: Sir!\\nALEC: Kill him. The man just won’t take a hint...\\nBORIS: Target coordinates...?\\nALEC: Target is London.\\n123 - Int. Engine room - Day\\nGears grind inside an engine room, moving the antenna into position.\\n124 - Ext. Dish - Day\\nBond and Natalya notice the movement.\\nNATALYA: He’s getting ready to signal the satellite.\\nBOND: How do you stop it?\\nNATALYA: The transmitter above the anten...\\nShe is interrupted by shots fired at them. They duck, then dive into the dish. Trevelyan’s soldiers are still firing at them as they slide faster and faster down into the bottom of the dish. We notice there’s a drop in the center where all the water must have drained into. Bond stops himself, bracing his feet at the ledge of the drop, then catches Natalya.\\nHe looks into the hole. We see a circular door in the bottom.\\n125 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nBoris is still seated at the computers.\\nBORIS: Antenna in position.\\nAlec hands Boris one of the two operational keys. They slip them into their slots.\\nALEC: On my count...3...2...1!\\nThey turn them at the same time. The same map we saw in Severnaya appears on the wall-size screen. A line moves to intercept London.\\n126 - Outer space\\nMischa moves into orbit.\\n127 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nAlec twists a red dial. “Weapon Armed”\\nALEC: God save the Queen.\\n128 - Int. Facility - Day\\nBond and Natalya climb down a ladder below the dish into the facility. Every soldier is on alert. The good guys move around stealthily as the soldiers shout out things in Spanish. Natalya spots a console to the mainframe.\\nNATALYA: The mainframe computer.\\nBOND: Don’t move!\\nHe takes off. James shoots two guards with the Walther, and hides behind a pillar. He notices Natalya climbing down a ladder to the mainframe, despite his orders.  007 fires at the soldiers again. He takes out two detonators and arms them. Soldiers get into better positions, aim at Bond. James realizes he’s outnumbered drastically. He slides the PPK across the floor and shows himself with his arms raised. A soldier shoves him against a wall, pats him down, looking for more weapons. Another soldier grabs him by the collar of his combat vest. We pan to the left showing...the detonators planted on a pouring tank of a pinkish, probably flammable liquid. Meanwhile, the soldiers are bringing Bond down the stairs to the control deck. We see Natalya poke her head out from behind a tank. She runs back into...\\n129 - Int. Mainframe - Day\\nInside a room that houses a terminal for the mainframe computer, Natalya sits down and begins to type...\\n130 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nThe soldiers escort Bond to where Alec is standing near Boris. His former friend notices 007.\\nALEC: James! What an unpleasant surprise.\\nBOND: We aim to please.\\nALEC: Where’s the girl?\\nNo answer from Bond. Like we expected one... Alec turns to his henchmen.\\nALEC: Find her!!\\nA few soldiers hurry to find her. On the table are the things that were found in Bond’s pockets; the Walther, a pen (Q’s pen...), and Bond’s passport. Alec fingers through them. He picks up the pen.\\nALEC: So how is ol’ Q? Up to his usual tricks? The watch.\\nBond sheds his watch. Alec compares it to his own. Slightly different.\\nALEC: Ah. New model. Still press here, do I?\\nHe presses a button, we cut to see the detonators disarm. The pink liquid is really starting to flood now...\\n131 - Int. Mainframe - Day\\nNatalya is still typing at the computer terminal.\\n132 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nWe see a screen. Looks similar to PC Banking. LOADS of cash. Bond knows what’s going on...\\nBOND: Interesting set-up, Alec. You break into the Bank of England via computer and transfer the money electronically. Just seconds before you set off the GoldenEye, which erases any record of the transactions. Ingenious.\\nALEC: Thank you, James.\\nBOND: But it still boils down to petty theft. In the end you’re just a bank robber. Nothing more than a common thief.\\nWell, that pisses Alec off. He stands up, very annoyed. Bond just has a special way of getting people mad at him...\\n133 - Int. Mainframe - Day\\nThe soldiers have located Natalya in the mainframe. She’s almost done... They grab her, but she manages to click ‘ENTER’. “Encryption in Progress”. Ouch.\\n134 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nALEC: You always did have a small mind, James. It’s not just erasing bank records, it’s everything on every computer in Greater London. Tax records. Stock market. Credit ratings. Land registries. Criminal records. In sixteen minutes and 43...42 seconds the United Kingdom will re-enter the Stone Age.\\nAs he speaks, he circles Bond.\\nBOND: A world-wide financial meltdown. And all so mad little Alec can settle a score with the world, 50 years old.\\nALEC: Oh, please James. Spare me the Froud. I might as well ask for all those vodka martinis that’ll silence the screams of all the men you’ve killed.\\nNatalya is brought into the room now. Alec glances at her.\\nALEC: Or if you’ll find forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women. For all the dead ones you’ve failed to protect. England is about to learn the cost of betrayal. Inflation adjusted from 1945.\\nHe turns to Natalya.\\nALEC: Welcome to the party, my dear.\\nBoris finally looks up to see who has just ‘joined the party’.\\nBORIS: Natalya!!\\nNatalya lunges at him and punches him in the face, he falls to the ground, cowering under the desk as Natalya continues to beat him up. Soldiers finally pull her away. Alec smirks. Boris puts his glasses back on, and picks up the grenade pen. He’s still on the floor, twirling it pen nervously. He gets up, visibly mad, and Boris faces Natalya.\\nBORIS: Don’t ever do that again!!\\nNATALYA: This is not one of your games, Boris. Real people will die! You pathetic little worm.\\nBoris goes to hit her, but Alec grabs his arm.\\nALEC: She was in the mainframe! Check the computer!\\nBoris yanks his arm free from Alec’s grasp.\\nBORIS: She’s a moron. A second level programmer. She works on the guidance systems.\\nNatalya looks as if she’d spit in Boris’ face.\\nBORIS: She doesn’t even have access to the firing codes.\\nHe spoke too soon. An alarm sounds. Boris runs to a computer. Natalya smirks.\\nBORIS: Retro-Rockets firing!\\n135 - Space\\nRockets fire from the satellite, moving it into the atmosphere.\\n136 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nBoris types away, twirling the pen with his right hand, clicking it a few times here and there. Bond watches the pen very attentively.\\nALEC: What the hell’s happening?!\\nBORIS: We’ll have re-entry in...12 minutes!\\n“Mission Aborted”\\nNATALYA: It’ll burn up somewhere over the Atlantic.\\nALEC: Deal with it!\\nBORIS: She changed the access codes!\\nALEC: Then she can fix it...!!\\nAlec takes out a pistol and shoves it in Bond’s jaw.\\nNATALYA: Go ahead, shoot him. He means nothing to me.\\nBond rolls his blue eyes.\\nBORIS: I can do it! I can break her codes!\\nALEC: Then get on with it!!\\nBoris types, twirls the pen. Clicks it two times...looking for three times... Bond watches...Boris drops the pen...Alec is fed up...he points the gun at Natalya.\\nALEC: Tell him! Now!\\nBoris stands up enraged. We hear the pen click three times. Bingo. Four seconds...\\nBORIS: Give me the codes, Natalya! Give them to me!!\\nBond knocks the pen from Boris, Bond and Natalya duck. The pen lands in the leaking pink liquid. KA-BOOM!! Huge explosion. Bond and Natalya break for the elevator.\\n137 - Int. Elevator - Day\\nBOND: Can Boris break your codes?\\nNATALYA: Possibly.\\nBOND: Possibly?! We have to destroy the transmitter.\\nNATALYA: By the way, I’m fine, thank you very much.\\n138 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nThat pink stuff was flammable. People are on fire, equipment is exploding.\\n139 - Ext. Elevator - Day\\nThe elevator stops at a tower near the antenna. A guard watches the doors open...revealing Natalya laying on the floor, her back to us. Where’s Bond? The guard approaches her and...Bond drops down from the ceiling of the elevator. He slams the guard into the metal walls. Bond hands Natalya the guard’s pistol.\\nBOND: Do you know how to use one of these?\\nNatalya slides the mag out, replaces the mag, cocks it. A real pro, folks!\\nNATALYA: Yes.\\nBOND: Good. Stand aside.\\nBond runs across a metal bridge leading to the antenna.\\n141 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nWhoever’s not dead is controlling the fire with extinguishers now. Alec walks up to Boris.\\nALEC: How long?\\nBORIS: Two minutes...one minute!\\nAlec yells to some soldiers.\\nALEC: Guard!\\nBORIS: I’m fixing it!\\nA soldier steps to Alec’s side.\\nALEC: If he moves, kill him.\\nThe soldier points a pistol at Boris’ head.\\n142 - Ext. Dish - Day\\nNatalya spots a helicopter...\\n143 - Ext. Antenna - Day\\nAlec runs to a cable car thing leading to the antenna.\\n144 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nBoris wipes the sweat from his glasses, typing in concentration.\\n145 - Space\\nThe satellite begins to enter the atmosphere, turning red-hot with friction.\\n146 - Ext. Bridge - Day\\nBond sprints up the narrow bridge, Alec is close behind him on the cable car. Alec fires an assault rifle at 007. Bond hits the deck, fires his own automatic. Alec runs out of ammo, so does Bond. Alec re-loads, Bond ditches the gun and runs up the bridge.\\n147 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nBoris is still typing...\\n148 - Ext. Bridge - Day\\nAlec finally takes a handgun and fires at the running 007, but misses him. Alec gets off the car and runs after Bond. He shoots again, Bond flies forward doing a mid-air somersault down an incline and continues. Alec re-loads.\\n149 - Int. Engine room - Day\\nBond hops down into the engine room for the transmitter.\\n150 - Int. Control deck - Day\\n“Send Command”. Boris cracked the code.\\nBORIS: YES! I am invincible!!\\nHe types away.\\n151 - Int. Engine room - Day\\nThe gears start to move again. Alec finds Bond. They fight, evenly matched. Bond throws 006 down the stairs and shoots a pistol at him. Just misses. But he has an idea of how to stop the antenna; the old fashioned way! Bond grabs a metal pole off the wall and shoves it in the gear belt. He runs down the stairs after Alec. We see the pole do its work. It’s now stuck between two gears.\\n152 - Int. Control deck - Day\\n“Antenna Malfunction”. Boris squeaks.\\n153 - Ext. Dish - Day\\nThe antenna screeches to a halt. Bond notices some blood on a railing. Still fresh. He hears a clang of metal-on-metal. Aims at the sound. Nothing. He jumps down into...\\n154 - Int. Another room - Day\\nThis room looks like it houses the electricity. Bond points the gun around, looking for Alec. Behind him Alec swings down through the door and kicks 007 in the face. They fight again, 006 appears to be winning. Both seem to know the other one’s next move. Both drop their guns, hand-to-hand now. Slamming each other against walls, punch, kick. James starts to get ahead of things, and blocks Alec’s hits. He slams him into a wall, Bond goes for a gun...Alec kicks it away, it fires at nothing. They push each other over tables, block each other’s hits. Whoa, both really know how their opponent fights. Alec gets the chance to grab a gun. He aims it at Bond who’s clings to a ladder, panting. ALEC: You know, James. I was always better.\\nJames kicks a lever just before Alec fires. The ladder he’s hanging on to drops down into the sun, very high above the dish. Bond hangs on for dear life...groaning as the ladder jerks to a stop.\\n155 - Ext. Rainforest - Day\\nNatalya sees Bond on the ladder in obvious trouble.\\n156 - Ext. Ladder - Day\\nAlec has run out of bullets. He takes out a radio, calls for the helicopter.\\nALEC: Alpha one to Gunship!\\n157 - Ext. Rainforest - Day\\nThe helicopter pilot gets in the chopper.\\nAlec (V.O.): Alpha one to Gunship!!\\n158 - Ext. Ladder - Day\\nBond starts to climb up the ladder, Alec starts to climb down.\\n159 - Int. Engine room - Day\\nThe gears and things are catching on fire...\\n160 - Ext. Ladder - Day\\nAlec decides to slide down the ladder, definitely quicker. He hits Bond with his feet, who slips but just grabs on to the last rung. By one arm.\\n161 - Ext. Rainforest - Day\\nThe chopper takes off.\\n162 - Ext. Ladder - Day\\nBond looks down. Whoa...WAY too far to jump. And live. No way! Alec, the epitamy of evil, places his boot on Bond’s knuckles. And stomps on it. James has no choice but to let go...and lands on part of the antenna. Only about six feet in diameter. Held up by wires. He can barely pull himself up.\\n168 - Space\\nThe satellite’s burning up now, in re-entry.\\n169 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nBoris is frantically shaking the monitor.\\nBORIS: SPEAK TO ME!!\\n170 - Ext. Ladder - Day\\nAlec jumps down to where Bond is and grabs him by the throat, holding him over the side. The helicopter flies into view. Alec looks at it for a spit second...\\n171 - Int. Helicopter cockpit - Day\\nNatalya appears in the chopper and presses a gun in the pilot’s temple.\\n172 - Ext. Ladder - Day\\nBond uses this window of opportunity. He kicks 006 off of him and flips him over the side. At the last second he grabs Alec’s foot. Do it in style, James...\\nALEC: For England, James?\\nBond’s icy eyes are that of a ruthless killer, now.\\nBOND: No. For me.\\nAnd with that he drops his ex-friend/neo-enemy. Alec hits the bottom of the disk with a sickening THUD.\\n173 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nBoris is SCREAMING at the top of his lungs, horror movie style.\\n174 - Space\\nThe satellite explodes in the Earth’s atmosphere.\\n175 - Ext. Dish - Day\\nAlec moves his head a little. Natalya forces the helicopter pilot to fly closer to 007.\\n176 - Int. Engine room - Day\\n...on fire.\\n177 - Ext. Ladder - Day\\nBond leaps and grabs hold of the chopper’s runners. They fly clear of the whole facility, the antenna’s gonna blow any minute...KA-BOOM! As the whole damn thing blows up and falls right on top of screaming Alec.\\n178 - Int. Control deck - Day\\nBoris pokes his head out of the rubble. In pieces, but he’s still alive. He jumps up triumphantly.\\nBORIS: I am invincible!!!\\nSpoke too soon, pal. Just as he says that the liquid nitrogen tanks explode, freezing him into place.\\n179 - Ext. Field - Day\\nThe chopper lets Bond fall to the ground in a clearing. Natalya jumps out, and it flies away. She drops on top of him. He flinches in pain. She’s worried, and stokes his black hair from his forehead.\\nNATALYA: James! James! Are you all right?!\\nBond recovers. Flashes a grin. Likes the position she put him in...\\nBOND: Yes, I’m fine. Thank you.\\nThey kiss, happy to be alive. They roll over so Bond’s on top. Natalya grins.\\nNATALYA: Suppose someone is watching....\\nHe continues to kiss her. They’re in the middle of nowhere, for god’s sake.\\nBOND: There’s no one in twenty-five miles, believe me.\\nThey kiss again. We hear a familiar voice...\\nWADE (O.S.): Yo! Jimbo!!\\nThere he goes with the ‘Jimbo’ again...James is really startled, he flips suddenly to his knees as soon as he hears that Southern accent. God, it’s Wade. In camo.\\nBOND: Is this supposed to be your idea of...um...coming through in a clinch?!\\nWADE: It’s the back-up plan. Hey, I’d said I’d be here, huh? Yo! Marines!\\nWade gives the USMC sign to reveal your position. About thirty-five Marines appear from nowhere, rising from the grass. Helicopters land around. What’s that...Bond’s blushing a little!\\nWADE: Maybe you two would like to finish de-briefing each other at Guantanamo?\\nBond looks at Natalya.\\nBOND: You ready?\\nNATALYA: I’m not going on that helicopter with you...\\nBond flashes her a quizzical look.\\nBOND: Hmmm?\\nNATALYA: No plane! No train! Nothing that moves!\\nHe picks her up. She’s still giggling. He gives us that grin again.\\nBOND: Darling, what could possibly go wrong, eh?\\nThe helicopters load up and fly out. Fade up on the credits, complete with “JAMES BOND WILL RETURN”.Embed',\n",

exactly Muslim shit\\nAnd I was like, what? good lord!\\nDiz, are you telling us?\\nThat through your entire battling career, and you\\'ve been battling for years, a third of your life, earning your stripes\\nYou led us to believe that you\\'re Muslim, and this whole motherfucking time\\nYou never actually said one\\nYou not exactly, I never was gonna say that\\nSee he says, I never said I was a Muslim\\nBut you say it in the battles, not the interviews\\nBut every time the interviewer calls you Muslim, you never correct or interrupt him\\nThat\\'s disgusting\\nDon\\'t play, I ain\\'t a bit amused\\nCause--\\n[Dizaster]\\nI\\'m an offshoot of Islam, that\\'s why\\n\\n[Soul Khan]\\nNhhh, yeah that\\'s debatable\\nBut relatable\\nSo\\nWell no I\\'m talking in your relation on what you do\\nYou misrepresent yourself to your fans and to your opponents\\nI want them to take themselves back to the moments\\nAnd the raps that you told em\\nUsing cultural standings that ain\\'t actually holding\\nAre you of the mind that just because racist thinks all Arabs are in terror groups\\nThat that makes it fair for you\\nTo uphold the stereotypes of terror too?\\nWhat about Muslims who aren\\'t Arab, dude?\\nYou don\\'t know think South Asians and African Muslims get hassled at customs?\\nOr that their women in hijabs and burkas are afraid of getting shot and murdered\\nDue to the rise in fucking Islamic, anti-Islamic fervor?\\nSo he has a rebuttal\\nI\\'m sure that shit is subtle\\nYou know a lot of the old Jewish lines I had were fucking foolish\\nBut the difference between that and you is\\nI\\'m actually fucking Jewish\\nLike, this here, was his decision\\nAnd now we in this position\\nYou hate the cultures vultures, what are you, a religion pigeon?\\nI mean obviously\\nYou\\'re Arab, so you know the language and the basic protocol\\nBut you faking overall\\nI guess Dizaster is just Arabic for Rachel Dolezal\\nEither way, you lied so these people have no reason to even slightly believe you\\nOr\\nI have just freed you\\nTo finally be you\\nDiz, do you hear this\\nDo you recognize the scheme\\nSee where I\\'m trying to lead you\\nIt\\'s Soul Khan, from the last tribe of the Hebrews\\nListen Diz, you can admit it\\nHonestly, you don\\'t wanna do it out loud\\nAnd that\\'s just too much to ask though\\nThat\\'s fine\\nIf you\\'re not Muslim, just stand here, looking like the world\\'s stupidest asshole\\nOh damnit, I\\'m so proud of you\\nThat probably took a lot of you\\nRight?\\nHonestly\\nI don\\'t wanna do anything more on this verse\\nBut if this contest of a honor, pride and our worth\\nIt\\'s just a motherfucking homicide in the first\\nBut, if that ain\\'t enough\\nYou just get to serve me\\nI don\\'t give a fuck\\nCause in 2021, your president is Bernie\\n(Diz: you done?)\\nI could be, hold on\\nI like you just wobbling back and forth\\n(Diz: c\\'mon pull something out, c\\'mon rebuttal something)\\nNo, I don\\'t want to right now\\nJust looking at you like, sorta like, wobbling, yeah go Diz, it\\'s your turn\\n\\n[Round 1: Dizaster]\\nOh it\\'s my turn?\\nY\\'all ready for some shit?!\\nWhat the fuck was that?\\nWhat the fuck was that?\\nAy trust me, we gon get to the Muslim in round 3, but right now\\nWoo!\\nWe gotta address fucking MC Dry Milk\\nThis ain\\'t a battle, this a race to see which one of us gon\\' be the first to get this guy killed\\nMe, or his white guilt\\nFucking Soul Khan\\nI\\'m not the person to step to\\nYeah, we gon\\' start off with this because honestly, I\\'m not here to

His name was Bachir just like me\\nHe had three younger brothers, and a little sister\\nSo now forced to raise them on his own, he had no chance but to look for a bigger picture\\nIn 1976, my pops saved up and bought his first car\\nHad it on top of the hill, just parked on it, and that\\'s when the civil war got started\\nA dude named Michel Aoun and the Christian Armed Forces dropped a bomb on it\\nNow when I say \"Christian\", y\\'all assume that I\\'m Muslim, right?\\nBut I\\'m Druze, I\\'m not Muslim\\nBut I loved them, they my brothers\\nBut back then, we was in a holy land grab over religion\\nA world driven by sectarianism\\nYou wouldn\\'t the meaning of a fucked up system\\nThe people where I\\'m from will die to live where you live in\\nTo eat the food that you eat to sip the water you drink\\nAnd that\\'s the reason you saw me protesting\\nBut since you a spoiled little American brat\\nI\\'ma explain America to you through my eyes to teach you this lesson\\nNow let\\'s go back to the 70\\'s where I left you in that last scene\\nWhere Michel Aoun blew up my father\\'s car in front of our house in Baakleen\\nNow this is where he knew he had to leave if he was to expand the family tree\\nBut life there was lookin\\' hopeless\\nSo the only place that could\\'ve gave us this life was the Land Of The Free\\nThis is why I love America\\nBecause my dad came here to build a path just for me\\nAnd after that, he went bankrupt and we moved permanently\\nThose next eight years would make me everything that I am\\nIn the street, playing soccer, bare feet, kickin\\' the can\\nIn the fuckin\\' mud \\'til the sun came down, shit that really turned a kid to a man\\nBut that was when you were in Woodland Hills with this little Gameboy in ya hand\\nSo you wouldn\\'t really understand would you?\\nYeah, cause all we had was to be able to go out and play\\nBut as Lebanese kids we were taught to be appreciative that in a way\\nEven though all we had was cold showers most of the time and four hours of electricity during the day\\nI lived through this shit\\nAnd through the rest of my settlement, my country would be going through this development\\nNow listen, you remember how I said the dude that blew up my dad\\'s car in the first segment?\\nOkay, this is why the whole thing is relevant\\nThis is the reason I said the shit\\nCause that same person, 30 years later has now been elected as our president\\nWe\\'re talking about somebody who\\'s a political war criminal who executed thousands by his hand\\nHe\\'s killed everything I love and that\\'s the reason I wave this flag\\nYou hate the president of America because I understand\\nHis policies make you mad\\nHe\\'s a goof, I know, the Tweets make you sad\\nBut guess what\\nI hate my president because he fuckin\\' broke up half my nation and damn near took away my dad\\nAnd listen, this is real shit\\nThey wanna start a holy war with Muslims, Druze and Christians\\nBut I will never go back to the ways that are old tradition\\nI would rather go over there and die with them then fight with them\\nThose are my brothers those are my sisters\\nI look at them like they my children\\nNow listen, I understand there\\'s inequality here towards blacks in this system\\nThat has nothing to do with him\\nI don\\'t care how he sees the views if they\\'ve never been used against him\\nSo for what it\\'s worth, you right, I\\'m not Muslim\\nI am Druze, alright?\\nDo you know what that means?\\nThat means we are under Walid Jumblatt, we are Socialist by birth\\nThat means, I can tell you firsthand that we\\'re supposed to be the most peaceful people on Earth\\nI mean, we\\'re supposed to be peaceful at birth\\nBut if you push us we can be some of the most fuckin\\' violent people on Earth\\nAnd the point being, is that you\\'re a fuckin\\' wanna-be Socialist\\nYou don\\'t know what you\\'re screwing with\\nSocialism is in my fucking bloodline and I want nothing to do with it\\nBecause I know first hand bro\\nTrust me, I\\'ve lived under this Socialist government shit\\nI\\'ll tell you first hand that nothing gets fixed\\nThe garbage doesn\\'t even get picked up, no one gives a fuck about shit\\nBut you wouldn\\'t understand because you an inexperienced, uncultured son of a bitch\\nThis ain\\'t about the joke you living or the votes you gettin\\' in the real world people carry guns then die over Socialism\\nYou want us to live in this global prison\\nWhere we take orders from these fuckin\\' old tradition senior citizens\\nThat are four times older than him\\nSo the main point, you ain\\'t never been through nothing like this\\nAnd go back to what we were saying on our parents\\nAlright? This is what it means to be a Lebanese-American\\nIt\\'s the journey it\\'s where we came from and where our parents been\\nSo since you think you gon\\' talk about my parents I\\'ma use my own parents to embarrass him\\nBack to when we was talkin\\' about your mom being a librarian\\nBut let\\'s go to your dad now\\nYou heard my dad\\'s story, oh you ready\\nYou heard my pop\\'s story, his struggle was hard\\nHe came here and turned an emotional scar and made himself to a star\\nAnd I\\'m following in his footsteps\\nWhich proves your pops is always a reflection of who you are\\nBut what about your dad?\\n\\n[Soul Khan] He was a piece of shit\\n\\n[Dizaster]\\nWell he was a lawyer, and that could be respected\\nBut then what happened?
