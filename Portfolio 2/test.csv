[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old-time stars
Through wars of worlds, invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know, or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you, we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

There's an old Kodak camera in my dresser drawer
I ran across it just this afternoon
And I realized that I don't ever use it anymore
In fact last time I did I think it was with you

[Chorus]
When we were down in Cozumel
We had the whole beach to ourselves
And it's crazy now to think
That it's all there on that film
And I could take it to the store
To be developed, but what for
I can still see everything just fine
And who needs pictures with a memory like mine

[Verse 2]
Standing there I couldn't help but think about
Everything that might be on that roll
I think it even has another trip we took
I guess that must've been at least three years ago

[Chorus]
When we were down in Baton Rouge
And there wasn't much to do
So we drove into New Orleans every afternoon
And I swear that you would think
That it was only yesterday
Cause I can still see everything just fine
Who needs pictures with a memory like mine

There's a cardboard box just sitting on a shelf

And it's been there ever since the night you left

To remind me of the past
Oh, but I can still see everything just fine
Who needs pictures with a memory like mine

Thou shall not search my pockets at night
Or annoy me with your hearsays
Commandment Seven
Thou shall not shout my name in the streets
If I am walking with another woman
But wait intelligently until I come home
Then we can both have it out decently
For I am your man, a funny man
And detest a scandal in public places
Commandment Eight
Thou shall not drink, or smoke
Nor use profane language
For those bad habits I will not stand for
Nine
Thou shall not commit adultery
For the world will not hold me guilty if I commit murder
Ten
Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's dress
Nor her shoes, nor her bureau, nor her bed, nor her hat
Nor anything that's hers
Neither shall thou call my attention to anything that may be for sale
In any stores, for I will not give thee anything
But what you actually need for your purpose
These are the ten commandments from man
Given to woman

Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass
It's like she loves me, she loves me not
Cause her friends pump her head full of bullshit a lot
I gave her jewels that I caught of a jux
Chanel bags I bought from boosters
To the hood I introduced her
She feisty, every now and then she wanna fight me
People saying if I get knocked she ain't gon' write me
The sick part is all that bullshit excites me

I said, ""I put one back behind the bar

There we were, lost in conversation
Before I handed her her purse

„Allzu sicher sollte seine Anhängerschaft noch nicht über das Finale spekulieren, er muss nämlich erstmal das Viertelfinale überleben. In der nächsten Runde wird es sehr viel schwieriger für ihn werden.“

[Part 1: Aytee]
Zuerst ein Kind, das wie 'ne Schwuchtel rappt
Und jetzt einer, der klingt, als ob er Schnupfen hätt'
Dass ich gewinn' ist kaum noch zu verhindern, Digga –
Schluckreflex
Ich pump' den Hundesohn hier voll Blei, Alter
Und Gary ist am abkratzen als würd' man ihm Rubbellose verteilen, ey
Und du willst gegen mich hier richtig heftig dicke Styles auffahr'n?
Doch ich mach' dir da 'n Strich durch die Rechnung wie bei Geteilt-Aufgaben
Selbst wenn ich beim Zugfahren die Strophe schreib' (Washington?)
Du kommst nicht aus den Staaten als wär' am Flughafen Pilotenstreik
Deine Freundin ist ein forsches Weib mit Borderline
Warum nennst du dich Gary? Du siehst mehr danach aus, als ob du Torben heißt
Die Slut wollt' ficken, ich hab' keine Lust gehabt
Ich baute mir 'nen Joint, sie hat die Runde gegen dich gehört und Schluss gemacht
Beim Blasen erleidet sie dank mein'm Pimmel 'nen Kieferkrampf
Komm schon Gary, zeig' uns mal wie stylisch du verlieren kannst
Du behauptest keine Zeit zu hab'n für zig Leute
Weil die dem Gary auf die Eier geh'n wie Filzläuse
Dein Name ist der Shit, Alter, was dachtest du dir, Mann?
Um ein Haar hättest du dich „Gary Aschaffenburg“ genannt
Mittlerweile hast du dich fast mit krassem Rap etabliert
Noch vor zwei Jahren hast du alltäglich Nackenschellen kassiert
Hiernach läufst du nur gebückt wie ein Suchhund
Dir kommt deine Vergangenheit in die Quere wie bei „Zurück in die Zukunft“
Mittlerweile hast du Style und behauptest du bangst am Block die Hur'n
Noch vor zwei Jahr'n warst du „LiL eXe“, die Brillenschlange mit Topffrisur

„Ja, der Text ist auch wieder ziemlich ... wir wollten ,Medium‘ machen sozusagen wie beim Steak.“
„Dann wurde es von ,Medium‘ zu ,Hart‘.“
„Ja, aber nicht ganz so hart wie wir könnten. Und, ja ...“
Ich war kein guter Mensch
Ich weiß, was ich gemacht hab', getan hab'
Oh, Vater, irgendwann ist Zahltag, dann war‘s das
Ich sag', dass ich nicht immer gut war, nicht treu war
Nicht nett war, nicht immer war Respekt da ...

[Part 2: Aytee]
Gary? Läuft bei dir! Doch Fakt ist, dass deine Fanbase enttäuscht sein wird
Denn ich fick' dich back in den Bauch von deiner Mom wie 'n Beuteltier
Sag mir, warum du hier den Harten spielst – Freakshow
Du musst dir deine Lines aus der Nase zieh'n wie 'n Speedpopel
Ich hab' schon MCs totgebattled
Da hast du noch mit Big-D auf dein'm Abschlussball Tracks von Bushido gerappt
Alter, bitte, wie schaffst du's, dich selbst denn noch ernst zu nehm'n?
Du würdest heut noch Gangsterrap machen, hätt'st du nicht Battles von Lance geseh'n
Hat dir gefall'n wa? Ja, hört man, nur taugst du Hure nix
Gary steht auf der Stage und lässt ein'n fahr'n wie Autoscooterchips
Meine Lines hab'n 's in sich, als ob ich sie flachgelegt und geschwängert hätte
Wie deine Sis, weil sie drauf abgeht als wär' 's 'ne Kellertreppe
Lass mal die Männer rappen, yo, Parts, die dich bang'n
Du fliegst nach 'nem Schlag aus dein'n Vans – ich bin nicht das K-Element
Du machst ein'n auf Star für die Fans, ich hab' 'nen Haufen Lines wie ein Strichcodezeichen
Du musst dank Hipstertrend nicht mehr rumlaufen in dein'n Fishbone-Kleidern
Yo, ich zerfick' dein Gesicht, so als ob ich Kimbo Slice wär'
Dein'n billigen Piss dreh' ich prinzipiell schon im Intro leiser
Wir sind beide stoned, nur ich hab's derbe drauf
Du entdeckst den Rest in meinem Bongkopf und fragst: „Yo, kann ich den fertig rauchen?“
Aytee! Bringt mir meine Gegner, ich werd' jeden töten
Du stellst in mein'n Augen kein Problem dar, wie mein Sehvermögen
Du fliegst, nachdem ich dich tret', durch deine Ikea-Möbel
Dein Style basiert auf 'ner Entzündung deiner Nebenhöhlen
Zumindest klingt das so – clean wie mein Pisstest
Yo, du siehst aus, als ob deine Mom mit 'nem T-Rex gefickt hätt'
Sie wird dauerbekifft in' Arsch gebumst
Dein Kopf ist so verdammt eckig, Mann, ich dreh' dir mit 'nem Schraubenschlüssel den Kragen um
Ich schreib' auf den Reisekoffer „Parts für Gegner“
Was für „bau den Spliff“? Hiernach mach' ich dir 'nen Teilzeitjob klar als Nasenleger
Komm vorbei, Mann, und ich schreib' dir deine Strophe
Und dann ist das fair, denn ich bin viel zu tight wie deine Hosen5Embed"

And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars!

Whatever happened to wilin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'

A shimmertrace of divinity lost
In the beckoning midnight vault
Lulled within the wake
Of a cold November's nightfall
Nightfall

Scattered in the depths of the universal dark
Above us minds went sailing free
And blossomed in the vast nocturnal sea

Defiantly blazing the black that awaits
Counting the days 'til the new Age awaits

Times' lustful cyclones arise
Piercing the fairest of Skies
In Elysian awakening of spiritual glory

Tragedies die among fiery flames
As the firewood of Wisdom is sawn

On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave

And before I get the butt, the Jim must be erect

test.00106.wav,"There's an old familiar hillside overlooking Emhouse, Texas
Where I left some childhood memories layin' round
I can almost hear the singing, i can still remember praying
At them old campground meetings eatin' chicken on the ground
With them hallelujahs ringin', everybody shoutin', singin'

Give me that old time religion, Jesus loves me, this I know
When life was finger-lickin' good and God lived in our neighborhood
At them old campground meetin's eatin' chicken on the ground

I can still remember feelin' all that happiness inside me
When I praised the Lord and laid my burdens down
But that chicken must have tasted better than the word of God
'Cause it went slippin' through my fingers and rollin' on the ground

Give me that old time religion, Jesus loves me, this I know
When life was finger-lickin' good and God lived in our neighborhood
At them old campground meetin's eatin' chicken on the ground

I reckon everyone of us can call back or remember
When the taste and smell of youth was all around
And I reckon in our own way everyone of us is payin' now
For eatin' chicken and not listenin' to old Parson Brown

Yo, I ain't one to complain, but there's things in the game

(And why's that?) American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend
Don't stress that, 'cause it's not in your bloodstream
Your whole being comes from greatness—d'you remember?
Shaytan got you caught in the storms of December
And brothers on the block packing nines, like September
Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender (Check it)
Yo, I be on the avenue where they be actin brand-new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty-boo
All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'
My hand was on my toolie they was actin' unruly
(Say word) Yo, word up! Yo, I was tight, caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies
Yo, we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flamming, steady running off at the Willie
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot, so on my girls, I blow
Shook them shits in my palm, let 'em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs, po-po
I got to go on the ave'; see, my parole by four
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo
And I was doing it 'til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite
Yo, I know the feeling—when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts, but the evils be revealin'
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (No doubt)

Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whipped cream before the water runs dry

If you came to the jam, well, I'm glad you came
See, ""nigga"" first was used down in the Deep South
Fallin' out between the dome of the white man's mouth
It means that we will never grow, you know the word, dummy

Sold their souls straight down the line

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars, all alone

Well it was there I found, beside the Alamo
Enchantments strange as the blue up above
For that moonlit pass, that only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon in all your splendor, known only to my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose, my rose of San Antone

We can go dancing, we can go walking
As long as we're together (As long as we're together)
Listen to some music, maybe just talking
Get to know you better (Get to know you better)

[Pre-Chorus: Agnetha, Agnetha & Frida]
'Cause you know I've got
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you
It's magic
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair
But I think you know
That I can't let go

[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida, Benny & Björn]
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
(Take a chance, take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
Honey, I'm still free; take a chance on me
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance, take a chance)
(Take a chance, take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
Honey, I'm still free; take a chance on me

Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie

If you put me to the test, if you let me try

Oh, you can take your time, baby, I'm in no hurry

You don't wanna hurt me, baby, don't worry
I ain't gonna let you (I ain't gonna let ya)

You say that I waste my time, but I can't get you off my mind
No, I can't let go
'Cause I love you so

Well, in North Carolina, way back in the hills
Me and my old pappy, and he had him a still
He brewed white lightnin' till the sun went down
And then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty, mighty pleasin', pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

[Chorus]
Well, the G men, T men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept on cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

[Verse 2]
Well, I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Lightnin' started flashin', thunder started clashin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

[Chorus]
Well, the G men, T men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept on cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

Well, a city slicker came and he said ""I'm tough
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff""
He took one s-slug and he drank it right down
And I heard him a-moanin' as he hit the ground
Mighty, mighty pleasin', your pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

[Chorus]
The G men, T men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
