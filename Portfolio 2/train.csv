I wrote my woman a letter, good people
And I told her I was in jail
She wrote me back an answer
Said now honey Im soon come and go your bail
All around this old jail house is haunted, good people
Forty dollars won't pay my fine
Corn liquor surrounds my body
And pretty women aching my mind
If I would've listened to my mama, good people
I wouldn't have been here today
Drinking and shooting and gambling
At home I could not stay
Dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow
Dig a hole in the ground

Give me corn bread when Im hungry, good people
Corn whisky when Im dry

country.00018.wav,"The rain is falling lightly on the buildings and the cars
I said goodbye to city friends, department stores and bars
The lights of town are at my back, my heart is full of stars
And I'm gonna be a country girl again.

I've spent some time in study, I've taken my degrees
I've memorized my formular, my A's and B's and C's
But what I know came long ago and not from such as these
And I'm gonna be a country girl again.

Chorus:
Oh yes, I'm gonna be a country girl again
With an old brown dog and a big front porge and rabbits in the pen
I tell you all the lights on Broadway don't amount to an acre of green
And I'm gonna be a country girl again.

I've wandered in the hearts of men, looking for a sign
That here I might learn happiness, I might learn peace of mind
The one who taught my lesson was the south wind through the pines
And I'm gonna be a country girl again.

No I leave me down to sleep
And if I sleep perhaps I'll dream
And if I dream I'll be with you
In the shelter of your arms
I pray that God will leak tonight
And grant me time before the light
For the light of day will take me from the shelter of your arms

And though I know it's just a dream
A dream that soon must end
The arms I feel I know are real
And I'm happy once again

I pray my dreams he'll let me keep

I did some research, one defect with the human mind is

See URL tightly watches this culture and checks the climate
The algorithms, for those that don't know what them squiggly lines is, it's simple
For every dollar made, DNA deserves like five of 'em
He deserves a bonus from this culture for the services he provided
Now let me break this down
If the workin' man workin' all day and street niggas dyin'
That mean the nerds bringin' in all these views and all these ""likes"" then
This a business and in every business the customer right, yeah?
Gotta serve the geeks a face they relate to that's kinda like them
Him right here
So they download and they spam this virus to every household and hand devices
So roses can't grow from concrete but dandelions look dangerous in the den of lions
This man inspires geeks and nerds who come from silver spoon houses with cans of cider that they can be liars

And it's cool cause it's only just rap when that camera's by him
You can't time my rounds my raps timeless
Call for Smack to call ""time"" I'ma cover Smack mouth then my hand rises

In yo' blogs you channel Tyson but yo' stance in the ring like a damn Irish
Ain't nan like him, you're now facin' the Island God

Bitch I land gods
I'm throwin' punches, stay focused where your eyes land god
When I miss I barely miss, but when I land...gawd!

Now Verb, let's break down this thing you call ""wizardry""
Cause you disguised your rhymes to blind the eyes that you incline lyrically
You use poetry tools, metaphors, similes
Alteration, imagery
So the picture you paintin' for the viewer is seen vividly
It's repetition so it gets to me
Rhythm, you catch it instantly
The line breaks, it gets to me
Personification set viciously
It's no hope now, you never been broke down to this degree
And I'ma make the room flip cause you can't be too sick if I got the blueprint on how you lack ability
Aye Verb 101
I need everybody to jot this down
The rhythm is when he looks possessed
With his hands in the air like the cops around
The alteration? ""What's poppin'? I'm in pockets for a profit in the project now.""
The imagery? Rocket sounds, choppers 'round
Bullets playin' Ping Pong with King Kong in a gothic town
The personification? Zombies found, blood baths, watch him drown

Harry had to invest for you to get the shot, you just look Dumb and Dumber

You weak niggas can be gone tomorr'
And for a week only we mourn in sorrow
DNA; niggas with your DNA go to the pen' and become a grown lil' boy
Niggas wit' my DNA? Go to the pen and control the yard
See in front of rookies you appear cold
But not in front of Verb, I'm up here cold
I look the rare niggas look mere mortal in mirror mode
Your talent is Dr. Seuss, that's what we call that bro
It's easy for you to be considered a bar spitter, for you the bar set low
Ayo, it's three minute rounds, they ain't book me for a long time
Preview, 3D....
Damn
(So it's Showtime)
Build yo' confidence, open yo' arms out, boulder somethin'
Have your chest and shoulders touchin' like you big and bold or somethin'
You say I say the least, but I'm the most they quote lil' dummy
I'm cocky, holdin' my belt like cops when approachin' someone
You gotta kill me, so you can advance and stock rise
'Cause cornball rappers couldn't thrive until 'Pac died
Admit defeat (the feet), I stand for somethin', do not lie
So if we lock eyes and my tear (tier) drop I do not cry
Put my heart in my pen I'm done tryin'
I killed the comp' in the combines but the league owners used to turn they head and become blind
I put a hole where your heart lies
Iron Man lets sparks fly but Tony Starks still give a mark vibe outside that Mach 5
It hurts inside ya
God don't fuck witchu, He hurt you patna
He put you where this rap shit started, y'all the first to find it
No matter how many times you go on Funk Flex and wear fake designer
On paper yo' pen never come up; cursive writin'
Brain synthesizin', should I go loud and violent or clip the nozzle?
The kid sleepin', I'll do you a solid and sent it silent
You rap violent, but on the inside you cryin', yo' city dyin'
At a time y'all was Goliath of rhymin'
Let me remind him
You be on stage makin' these ugly ass faces cause you really tryin'
But out-of-towners make y'all defensive linemen look like the Giants
I am big dawg
I take a whole fist full of you fuckin' Shih Tzu's and knock you niggas down like fish food
I'm in a piss mood, I'm wit' war
You gauze your wounds and you keep goin'
When I bleed I just like my sores and I kept goin'
You spit that bull but when that bullshit come you quick run
Where I'm from, we run straight to that bull and we grip horns
I made my crown of prick thorns so I can bleed when we on stage
Bein' a god in the sky way too easy, I miss home
Don't pull up at this door if this core you ain't fit for
You're in (urine) the face of a nigga who from the bottom who wasn't even pissed that he was piss-poor
I'm from that soil, where the crack boil, nobody had so we don't hate
We laugh at you niggas that got spoiled
I connect with people and respect the evils
The higher up I go, I hold the struggle down
I could never fall off cause I never leave 'em
Extremist, I showed this culture I'm past devoted
I took the biggest patnas in URL house and smashed you roaches
I took a walk through the park in the blackest nights
I laid down and let the bears and werewolves take massive bites
I had to stare death in the eyes to enhance my sight
To gain passage rights to slowly drive your hearse through the afterlife with flashing hazard lights
Verb, battlin' dude, that ain't a smart move
Small room, large room, we can dance nigga, I turn 'em all into my ballroom nigga
You think you bigger than what you is, I don't understand it
We battle rappers, the most entertaining people on the planet
See I'm the nigga that put his head in the lion's mouth and I dare it
You gon' always be the clown gettin' shot out that cannon, lil' nigga can it

[Round 3: DNA]
I said, word to Big T
This the round I put a nigga from St. Louis out of misery (Missouri)
Y'all see how I had that doo rag and the hoodie and now I'm just in a tee?
Well that's because I'm the GOAT and you had to go through Mook and Lux to get to me
A lot of people said, ""Verb shouldn't be battlin' DNA""
Even ya clique doubted this
But here's where I sneak a GOAT and get a kick out of it
You battled two washed up nigga
Now before y'all say I'm dumb
Mook and Lux are both legends and in their era they had a crazy run
But Surf is like basketball, cause even though those names weigh a ton
Bill's 11 and Wilt's 100 just don't feel the same as Jordan 6's and Kobe's 81
So fuck Mook, fuck Lux
These the GOATs: Geechi tough tough
Ave and Nitty will leave you punch drunk
Shine'll slide up like a dancer with the nunchucks
Twork will hit you wit' the ""baow"" then the gun butt
Suge with the clutch dunk
Then Hitman {scratches} will remix the body to the dump truck
Surf, Roc, Clips, John John, Ars', we did too much stuff
We put this culture on our back, y'all got me fucked up
When we first started battle rap, you right, we ain't have the same buzz
When I got hot they critiqued me and put me down, I see that's what the fame does
Question my believability
Now it's jokes on how I can't drive and all this fake love
I guess y'all put DNA under the microscope to see what I'm made of
And now I'm here, you gon' understand when this verse done
Fuck drivin', I just got my girl a new whip, and a house
Far as respect, I deserve some
I just had to teach my grandma how to walk again cause she wouldn't let the nurse come
And the only steps bigger than that is my daughter's first one
I'm a king of this shit, I follow no rules
Fuck battle rap, I take care of my family, I'm really makin' GOAT moves
I had to put my dreams on hold, get a gun for protection, you couldn't survive what I go through
And now it's back to it's rightful owner, I gotta stand on my own two
The king is bustin', I'm sprayin' somethin'
What y'all confused?
I told my shooter, ""Aim for Duncan"" but once I show the .9, Verb will (nonverbal) see the signs without sayin' nothin'
You said, ""east coast niggas got ego issues""?
So as far as the hitters there's a lot of niggas I can tell sendin'
Your career I can help end it
So if I have Twork and Ars' assist (Narcissist) am I still self centered?
It's gonna get brutal
I told ya son, ""I killed ya faggot ass pops"" he like, ""Well, what he did to you?""
Well if I carry his body to the grave let's see if this spirit can live through you
You used to be tough, now you feminine
Your heart pumpin' estrogen
Cause with your lifestyle you made up a choice
I just wanna know how you vegan and you can't plant base in ya voice
The Midwest Movement ended cause of your jealousy
Cause when X-Factor got hot we saw the worst out him
You battled him to be part of the equation and that ain't even the first problem
When Calicoe got Lux you came up wit' a new plot, to take dude's spot
So was it worth it dummy? Thinkin' dirty money should come from Shoebox?
And with Hitman we saw all of it end
You got on that stage with rage but now you wanna pretend
You let your jealousy supercede your love, as far as detox I'm supportin' the cleanse
Cause you're right, that's the way you talk to your son, but not the way you talk to a friend
Fuckin' [?], I'm done with that
Yeah you ducked Iron Solomon but it's another situation I gotta touch on that
Let's play Swear To God
Swear to God you ain't tell ARP if Hitman got paid more verse Bill Collector you wouldn't get on it
Enough of that, here's another fact
You know how many times Shine got paid more than me on card?  I told 'em ""Double that""
Big T, Clips, T-Top, ""give 'em another rack""
I'm arguin' on the phone with URL like it's my money Smack
Yeah I freestyle, but I'm not here to rebuttal that
Cause I'll never let this business make me not have my brother's back
But the Jedi Mind Trick is you wore a ""Ball Game"" shirt vs Lux cause the loyalty was 'bout to leave
Never supposed to count ya man's pockets but you found the need
Worried about Gerald while it's (wallet) clear to see that that's out ya league
Night Of Rematches comin' up
My niggas ready and they wildin'
Gilligan, the wrong Skipper had a Professor on the Island
Why you got this hate for me?
The first bomber, you deserve karma, this ain't the place to be
Red Dot over the Island like Pearl Harbour and it's plain (plane) to see (sea)
I do, you did, I've been murderin' SMACK vets
I fight, you fought, that's why you been turnin', you wack since
I bleed, you bled, you ain't learn from the crash test
I do, you- I just put Verb in the past tense
It's round three it's gettin' hot in here
What's my slogan?
(Get him the fuck outta here!)
Get that grey hoodie and that tux the fuck in here
You owe me now, get Lux the fuck in hereEmbed",country

country.00037.wav,"A Place

So I have sailed the seas and come…

to B…
a small town fastened to a field in Indiana. Twice there have been twelve hundred people here to answer to the census. The town is outstandingly neat and shady, and always puts its best side to the highway. On one lawn there’s even a wood or plastic iron deer.
You can reach us by crossing a creek. In the spring the lawns are green, the forsythia is singing, and even the railroad that guts the town has straight bright rails which hum when the train is coming, and the train itself has a welcome horning sound.
Down the back streets the asphalt crumbles into gravel. There’s Westbrook’s, with the geraniums, Horsefall’s, Mott’s. The sidewalk shatters. Gravel dust rises like breath behind the wagons. And I am in retirement from love.

Weather

In the Midwest, around the lower Lakes, the sky in the winter is heavy and close, and it is a rare day, a day to remark on, when the sky lifts and allows the heart up. I am keeping count, and as I write this page, it is eleven days since I have seen the sun.

My House

There’s a row of headless maples behind my house, cut to free the passage of electrical wires. High stumps, ten feet tall, remain, and I climb these like a boy to watch the country sail away from me. They are ordinary fields, a little more uneven than they should be, since in the spring they puddle. The topsoil’s thin, but only moderately stony. Corn is grown one year, soybeans another. At dusk starlings darken the single tree—a larch—which stands in the middle. When the sky moves, fields move under it. I feel, on my perch, that I’ve lost my years. It’s as though I were living at last in my eyes, as I have always dreamed of doing, and I think then I know why I’ve come here: to see, and so to go out against new things—oh god how easily—like air in a breeze. It’s true there are moments—foolish moments, ecstasy on a tree stump—when I’m all but gone, scattered I like to think like seed, for I’m the sort now in the fool’s position of having love left over which I’d like to lose: what good is it now to me, candy ungiven after Halloween?

A Person

There are vacant lots on either side of Billy Holsclaw’s house. As the weather improves, they fill with hollyhocks. From spring through fall, Billy collects coal and wood and puts the lumps and pieces in piles near his door, for keeping warn in his one work. I see him most often on mild days sitting on his doorsill in the sun. I notice he’s squinting a little, which is perhaps the reason he doesn’t cackle as I pass. His house is the size of a single garage, and very old. It sheds its paint with its youth, and its boards are a warped and weathered gray. So is Billy. He wears a short lumpy faded black coat when it’s cold, otherwise he always goes about in the same loose, grease-spotted shirt and trousers. I suspect his galluses were yellow once, when they were new.

Wires

These wires offend me. Three trees were maimed on their account, and now these wires deface the sky. They cross like a fence in front of me, enclosing the crows with the clouds. I can’t reach in, but like a stick, I throw my feelings over. What is it that offends me? I am on my stump, I’ve built a platform there, and the wires prevent my going out. The cut trees, the black wires, all the beyond birds therefore anger me. When I’ve wormed through a fence to reach a meadow, do I ever feel the same about the field?

The Church
The church has a steeple like the hat of a witch, and five birds, all doves, perch in its gutters.

My House

Leaves move in the windows. I cannot tell you yet how beautiful it is, what it means. But they do move. They move in the glass.

Politics

…for all those not in love.
I’ve heard Batista described as a Mason. A farmer who’d seen him in Miami made this claim. He’s as nice a fellow as you’d ever want to meet. Of Castro, of course, no one speaks.
For all those not in love there’s law: to rule…to regulate…to rectify. I cannot write the poetry of such proposals, the poetry of politics, though sometimes—often—always now—I am in that uneasy peach of equal powers which makes a State; then I communicate by passing papers, proclamations, orders, through my bowels. Yet I was not a State with you, nor were we both together any Indiana. A squad of Perching Rifles at the moment, I make myself Right Face! Legislation packs the screw of my intestines. Well, king of the classroom’s king of the hill. You used to waddle when you walked because my sperm between your legs was draining to a towel. Teacher, poet, folded lover—like the politician, like those drunkards, ill, or those who faucet-off while pissing heartily to preach upon the force and fullness of that stream, or pause from vomiting to praise the purity and passion of their puke—I chant, I beg, I orate, I command, I sing—

Come back to Indiana—not too late!
(or will you be a ranger to the end?)
Good-bye…Good-bye…oh, I shall always wait
You, Larry, traveler—
stranger,
son,
—my friend—
my little girl, my poem by heart, my self, my childhood.
But I’ve heard Batista described as a Mason. That dries up my pity, melts my hate. Back from the garage where I have overheard it. I slap the mended fender of my car to laugh, and listen to the metal stinging tartly in my hand.

People

Their hair in curlers and their heads wrapped in loud scarves, young mothers, fattish in trousers, lounge about in the speedwash, smoking cigarettes, eating candy, drinking pop, thumbing magazines, and screaming at their children above the whir and rumble of the machines.
At the bank  a young man freshly pressed is letting himself in with a key. Along the street, delicately teetering, many grandfathers move in a dream. During the murderous heat of the summer, they perch on window ledges, their feet dangling just inside the narrow shelf of shade the store has made, staring steadily into the street. Where their consciousness has gone I can’t say. It’s not in the eyes. Perhaps it’s diffuse, all temperature and skin, like an infant’s, though more mild. Near the corner there are several large overalled men employed in standing.  A truck turns to be weighed on the scales at the Feed and Grain. Images drift on the drugstore window. The wind has blown the smell of cattle into town. Our eyes have been driven in like the eyes of the old men. And there’s no one to have mercy on us.
Vital Data

There are two restaurants here and a tearoom, two bars. one bank, three barbers, one with a green shade with which he blinds his windows. two groceries. a dealer in Fords. one drug, one hardware, and one appliance store. several that sell feed, grain, and farm equipment. an antique shop. a poolroom. a laundromat. three doctors. a dentist. a plumber. a vet. a funeral home in elegant repair the color of a buttercup.  numerous beauty parlors that open and shut like night-blooming plants. a tiny dime and department store of no width but several floors. a hutch, homemade, where you can order, after lying down or squirming in, furniture that’s been fashioned from bent lengths of stainless tubing, glowing plastic, metallic thread, and clear shellac. an American Legion Post and a root beer stand. little agencies for this and that: cosmetics, brushes, insurance, greeting cards and garden produce—anything—sample shoes—which do their business out of hats and satchels, over coffee cups and dissolving sugar. a factory for making paper sacks and pasteboard boxes that’s lodged in an old brick building bearing the legend OPERA HOUSE, still faintly golden, on its roof. a library given by Carnegie. a post office. a school. a railroad station. fire station. lumberyard. telephone company. welding shop. garage…and spotted though the town from one end to the other is a line along the highways, gas stations to the number five.

Education

In 1833, Colin Goodykoontz, an itinerant preacher with a name from a fairytale, summed up the situation in one Indiana town this way:
Ignorance and her squalid brood. A universal dearth of intellect. Total abstinence 	from literature is very generally practiced…There is not a scholar in grammar or 	geography, or a teacher capable of instructing in them, to my knowledge…Others are 	supplied a few months of the year with the most antiquated & unreasonable forms 	of teaching reading, writing & ciphering…Need I stop to remind you of the host of 	loathsome reptiles such a stagnant pool is fitted to the breed! Croaking jealousy; 	bloated bigotry; coiling suspicion; warmish blindness; crocodile malice!

Things have changed since then, but in none of the respects mentioned.

Business

One side of the street is blocked off with sawhorses. Hard, thin, butter men in blue jeans, cowboy boots and hats, untruck a dinky carnival. The merchants are promoting themselves. There will be free rides, raucous music, parades and coneys, pop, popcorn, candy, cones, awards and drawings, with all you can endure of pinch, push, bawl, shove, shout, scream, shriek, and bellow. Children pedal past on decorated bicycles, their wheels a blur of color, streaming crinkled paper and excited dogs. A little later there’s a pet shot for a prize—dogs, cats, birds, sheep, ponies, goats—none of which wins. The whirlabouts whirl about. The Ferris wheel climbs dizzily into the sky as far as a tall man on tiptoe might be persuaded to reach, and the irritated operators measure the height and weight of every child with sour eyes to see if they are safe for the machines. An electrical megaphone repeatedly trumpets the names of the generous sponsored. The following day they do not allow the refuse to remain long in the street.

My House, This Place and Body

I have met with some mischance, wings withering, as Plato says obscurely, and across the breadth of Ohio, like heaven on a table, I’ve fallen as far as the poet, to the sixth sort of body, this house in B, in Indiana, with its blue and gray bewitching windows, holy magical insides. Great thick evergreens protect its entry. And I live in.
Lose in the corn rows, I remember feeling just another stalk, and thus this country takes me over in the way I occupy myself when I am well…completely—to the edge of both my house and body. No one notices, when they walk by, that I am brimming in the doorways. My house, this place and body, I’ve come in mourning to be born in. To anybody else it’s pretty silly: love. Why should I feel a loss? How am I bereft? She was never mine; she was a fiction, always a golden tomgirl, barefoot, with an adolescent’s slouch and a boy’s taste for sports and fishing, a figure out of Twain, or worse, in Riley.
Age cannot be kind.
There’s little hand-in-hand here…not in B. No one touched except in rage. Occasionally girls will twine their arms about each other and lurch along, school out, toward home and play. I dreamed my lips would drift down your back like a skiff on a river. I’d follow a vein with the point of my finger, hold your bare feet in my naked hands.

The Same Person

Billy Holsclaw lives alone—how alone it is impossible to fathom. In the post office he talks greedily to me about the weather. His head bobs on a wild flood of words, and I take this violence to be a measure of his eagerness for speech. He badly needs a shave, coal dust has layered his face, he spits when he speaks, and his fingers pick at his tatters. He wobbles out in the wind when I leave him, a paper sack mashed in the fold of his arms, the leaves blowing past him, and our encounter drives me sadly home to poetry—where there’s no answer. Billy closes his door and carries coal or wood to his fire and closes his eyes, and there’s simply no way of knowing how lonely and empty he is or whether he’s as vacant and barren and loveless as the rest of us are—here in the heart of the country.
Weather

For we’re always out of luck here. That’s just how it is—for instance in the winter. The sides of buildings, the roofs, the limbs of the trees are gray. Streets, sidewalks, faces, feelings—they are gray. Speech is gray, and the grass where it shows. Every flank and front, each top is gray. Everything is gray: hair, eyes, window glass, the hawkers’ bills and touters’ posters, lips, teeth, poles and metal signs—they’re gray, quite gray. Cars are gray. Boots, shoes, suits, hats, gloves are gray. Horses, sheep, and cows, cats killed in the road, squirrels in the same way, sparrows, doves, and pigeons, all are gray, everything is gray, and everyone is out of luck who lives here.
A similar haze turns the summer sky milky, and the air muffles your head and shoulders like a sweater you’ve got caught in. In the summer light, too, the sky darkens a moment when you open your eyes. The heat is pre distraction. Steeped in out fluids, miserable in the folds of our bodies, we can scarcely think of anything but our sticky parts. Hot cyclonic winds and storms of dust crisscross the country. In many places, given an indifferent push, the wind will still coast for miles, gathering resource and edge as it goes, cunning and force. According to the season, paper, leaves, field litter, seeds, snow, fill up the fences. Sometimes I think the land is flat because the winds have leveled it, they blow so constantly. In any case, a gale can grow in a field of corn that’s as hot as a draft from hell, and to receive it is one of the most dismaying experiences of this life, though the smart of the same wind in winter is more humiliating, and in that sense even worse. But in the spring it rains as well, and the trees fill with ice.

Place

Many small Midwestern towns are nothing more than rural slums, and this community could easily become one. Principally during the first decade of the century, though there were many earlier instances, well-to-do farmers moved to town and built fine homes to contain them in their retirement. Others desired a more social life, and so lived in, driving to their fields like storekeepers to their businesses. These houses are now dying like the bereaved who inhabit them; they are slowly losing their senses—deafness, blindness, forgetfulness, mumbling, an insecure gait, an uncontrollable trembling has overcome them. Some kind of Northern Snopes will occupy them next: large-familied, Catholic, Democratic, scrambling, vigorous, poor; and since the parents will work in larger, nearby towns, the children will be loosed upon themselves and upon the hapless neighbors much as the fabulous Khan loosed his legendary horde. These Snopes will undertake makeshift repairs with materials that other people have thrown away; paint halfway round their house, then quit; almost certainly maintain an ugly loud cantankerous dog and underfeed a pair of cats to keep the rodents down. They will collect piles of possibly useful junk in the back yard, park their cars in the front, live largely leaning over engines, give not a hoot for the land, the old community, the hallowed ways, the established clans. Weakening widow ladies have already begun to hire large rude youths from families such as these to rake and mow and tidy the grounds they will inherit.

People

In the cinders at the station boys sit smoking steadily in darkened cars, their arms bent out the windows, white shirts glowing behind the glass. Nine o’clock is the best time. They sit in a line facing the highway—two or three or four of them—idling their engines. As you walk by a machine may growl at you or a pair of headlights flare up briefly. In a moment one will pull out, spinning cinders behind it, to stalk impatiently up and down the dark streets or roar half a mile into the country before returning to its place in line and pulling up.

My House, My Cat, My Company

I must organize myself. I must, as they say, pull myself together, dump this cat from my lap, stir—yes, resolve, move, do. But do what? My will is like the rosy dustlike light in this room: soft, diffuse, and gently comforting. It lets me do…anything…nothing. My ears hear what they happen to: I eat what’s put before me; my eyes see what blunders into them; my thoughts are not thoughts, they are dreams. I’m empty or I’m full…depending: and I cannot choose. I sink my claws in Tick’s fur and scratch the bones of his back until his rear rises amorously. My. Tick, I murmur, I must organize myself. I must pull myself together. And Mr. Tick rolls over on his belly, all ooze.
I spill  Mr. Tick when I’ve rubbed his stomach. Shoo. He steps away slowly, his long tail rhyming with his paws. How beautifully he moves, I think; how beautifully, like you, he commands his loving, how beautifully he accepts. So I rise and wander from room to room, up and down, gazing through most of my forty-one windows. How well this house receives its loving too. Let out like Mr. Tick, my eyes sink in the shrubbery. I am not here; I’ve passed the glass, passed second-story spaces, flown by branches, brilliant berries, to the ground, grass high in seed and leafage every season; and it is the same as when I passed above you in my aged, ardent body; it’s, in short, a kind of love; and I am learning to restore myself, my house, my body, by paying court to gardens, cats, and running water, and with neighbors keeping company.
Mrs. Desmond is my right-hand friend; she’s eighty-five. A thin white mist of hair, fine and tangled, manifests the climate of her mind. She is habitually suspicious, fretful, nervous. Burglars break in at noon. Children trespass. Even now they are shaking the pear tree, stealing rhubarb, denting lawn. Flies caught in the screens and numbed by frost awake in the heat to buzz and scrape the metal cloth and frighten he, through the hollow rooms. It is herself she hears, her own flesh failing, for only death will preserve her from those daily chores she climbs like stairs, and all that anxious waiting. Is it now, she wonders. No? Then: is it now?
We do not converse. She visits me to talk. My task is to murmur. She talks about her grandsons, her daughter who lives in Delphi, her sister or her husband—both gone—obscure friends—dead—obscurer aunts and uncles—lost—ancient neighbors, members of her church or of her clubs—passed or passing on: and in this way she brings the ends of her life together with a terrifying rush: she is a girl, a wife, a mother, widow, all at once. All at once—appalling—but I believe it; I wince in expectation of the clap. Her talk’s a fence—a shade drawn, window fastened, door that’s locked—for no one dies taking tea in a kitchen: and as her years compress and begin to jumble, I really believe in the brevity of live; I sweat in my wonder; death is the dog down the street, the angry gander, bedroom spider, goblin who’s come to her; and it occurs to me that in my listening posture I’m the boy who suffered the winds of my grandfather with an exactly similar politeness, that I am, right now, all my ages, out in elbows, as angular as badly stacked cards. Thus was I, when I loved you, every man I could be, youth and child—far from enough—and you, so strangely ambiguous a being, met me, heart for spade, play after play, the whole run of our suits.
Mr. Tick, you do me honor. You not only lie in my lap, but you remain alive there, coiled like a fetus. Through your deep nap, I feel you hum. You are, and are not, a machine. You are alive, alive exactly, and it means nothing to you—much to me. You are a cat—you cannot understand—you are a cat so easily. Your nature is not something you much rise to. You, not I, live in: in house, in skin, in shrubbery. Yes. I think I shall hat my head with a steeple; turn church; devour people. Mr. Tick, though, has a tail he can twitch, he need not fly his Fancy. Claws, not metrical schema, poetry his paws; while smoothing…smoothing…smoothing roughly, his tongue laps its neatness. O Mr. Tick, I know you; you are an electrical penis. Go on now, shoo. Mrs. Desmond doesn’t like you. She thinks you will tangle yourself in her legs and she will fall. You murder her birds, she knows, and talking upon her roof with death in your jaws. I must gather myself together for a bound. What age is it I’m at right now, I wonder. The heart, don’t they always say, keeps the true time. Mrs. Desmond is knocking. Faintly, you’d think, but she pounds. She’s brought me a cucumber. I believe she believes I’m a woman. Come in, Mrs. Desmond, thank you, be my company, it looks lovely, and have tea. I’ll slice it, crisp, with cream, for luncheon, each slice as thin as me.

Politics

O all ye isolate and separate powers, Sing! Sing, and sing in such a way that from a distance it will seem a harmony, a Strindberg play, a friendship ring…so happy—happy, happy, happy—as here we go hand in handling, up and down. Our union was a singing, though we were silent in the songs we sang like single notes are silent in a symphony. In no sense sober, be barbershopped together and never heard the discords in our music or saw ourselves as dirty, cheap, or silly. Yet cats have worn out better shoes than those thrown through our love songs at us. Hush.  Be patient—prudent—politic. Still, Cleveland killed you, Mr. Crane. Were you not politic enough and fond of being beaten? Like a piece of sewage, the city shat you from its stern three hundred miles from history—beyond the loving reach of sailors. Well, I’m not a poet who puts Paris to his temple in his youth to blow himself from Idaho, or—fancy that—Missouri. My god, I said, this is my country, but must my country go so far as Terre Haute or Whiting, go so far as Gary?
When the Russians first announced the launching of their satellite, many people naturally refused to believe them. Later others were outraged that they had sent a dog around the earth. I wouldn’t want to take that mutt from our that metal flying thing if he’s still living when he lands, our own dog catcher said; anybody knows you shut a dog up by himself to toss around the first thing he’ll be setting on to do you let him out is bite somebody.
This Midwest. A dissonance of parts and people, we are a consonance of Towns. Like a man grown fat in everything but heart, we overlabor; our outlook never really urban, never rural either, we enlarge and linger at the same time, as Alice both changed and remained in her story. You are blond. I put my hands upon your belly; feel it tremble from my trembling. We always drive large cars in my section of the country. How could you be a comfort to me now?

More Vital Data

The town is exactly fifty houses, trailers, stores, and miscellaneous buildings long, but in places no streets deep. It takes on width as you drive south, always adding to the east. Most of the dwellings are fairly spacious farm houses in the customary white, with wide wraparound porches and tall narrow windows, though there are many of the grander kind—fretted, scalloped, turreted, and decorated with clapboards set at angles or on end, with stained-glass windows at the stair landings and lots of wrought iron full of fancy curls—and a few of these look like castles in their rarer brick. Old stables serve as garages now, and the lots are large to contain them and the vegetable and flower gardens which, ultimately, widows plant and weed and then entirely disappear in. The shade is ample, the grass is good, the sky a glorious fall violet; the apple trees are heavy and red, the roads are calm and empty; corn has sifted from the chains of tractored wagons to speckle the streets with gold and with the russet fragments of the cob, and a man would be a fool who wanted, blessed with this, to live anywhere else in the world.

Education

Buses like great orange animals move through the early light to school. There the children will be taught to read and warned against Communism By Miss Janet Jakes. That’s not her name. Her name is Helen something—Scott or James. A teacher twenty years. She’s now worn fine and smooth, and has a face, Wilfred says, like a mail-order ax. Her voice is hoarse, and she has a cough. For she screams abuse. The children stare, their faces blank. This is the thirteenth week. They are used to it. You will all, she shouts, you will all draw pictures of me. No. She is a Mrs.—someone’s missus. And in silence they set to work while Miss Jakes jabs hairpins in her hair. Wilfred says an ax, but she has those rimless tinted glasses, graying hair, an almost dimpled chin. I must concentrate. I must stop making up things. I must give myself to live; let it mold me: that’s what they say in Wisdom’s Monthly Digest every day. Enough, enough—you’ve been at it long enough; and the children rise formally a row at a time to present their work to her desk. No, she wears rims; it’s her chin that’s dimple-less. Well, it will take more than a tablespoon for features to sweeten that face. So she grimly shuffles their sheets, examines her reflection crayoned on them. I would not dare…allow a child…to put a line around me. Though now and then she smiles like a nick in the blade, in the end these drawings depress her. I could not bear it—how can she ask?—that anyone…draw me. Her anger’s lit. That’ why she does it: flame. There go her eyes; the pink in her glasses brightens, dims. She is a pumpkin, and her rage is breathing like the candle in. No, she shouts, no—the cartoon trembling—no, John Mauck, John Stewart Mauck, this will not do. The picture flutters from her fingers. You’ve made me too muscular.
I work on my poetry. I remember my friends, associates, my students, by their names. Their names are Maypop, Dormouse, Upsydaisy. Their names are Gladiolus, Callow Bladder, Prince and Princess Oleo, Hieronymus, Cardinal Mummum, Mr. Fitchew, The Silken Howdah, Spot. Sometimes you’re Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn; it is perpetually summer; your buttocks are my pillow; we are adrift on a raft; your back is our river. Sometimes you are Major Barbara, sometimes a goddess who kills men in battle, sometimes you are soft like a shower of water; you are bread in my mouth.
I do not work on my poetry. I forget my friends, associates, my students, and their names: Gramophone, Blowgun, Pickle, Serenade…Marge the now in B, in Indiana: out of job and out of patience, out of love and time and money, out of bread and out of body, in a temper, Mrs. Desmond, out of tea. So shut your fist up, bitch, you bag of death; go bang another door; go die, my dearie. Die, life-deaf old lady. Spill your breath. Fall over like a frozen board. Gray hair grows from the nose of your mind. You are a skull already—memento mori—the foreskin retracts from your teeth. Will your plastic gums last longer than your bones, and color their grinning? And is………bitch. I wanted to be famous, but you bring me age—my emptiness. Was is that which I thought would balloon me above the rest? Love? where are you?...love me. I want to rise so high, I said, that when I shit I won’t miss anybody.

Business

For most people, business is poor. Nearby cities have siphoned off all but a neighborhood trade. Except for feed and grain and farm supplies, you stand a chance to sell only what one runs out to buy. Chevrolet has quit, and Frigidaire. A locker plant has left its afterimage. The lumberyard has been, so far, six months about its going. Gas stations change hands clumsily, a restaurant becomes available, a grocery closes. One day they came and knocked the cornices from the watch repair and pasted campaign posters on the windows. Torn across, by now, by boys, they urge you still to vote for half an orange beblazoned man who as a while one failed two years ago to win at his election. Everywhere, in this manner, the past speaks, and it mostly speaks of failure. The empty stores, the old signs and dusty fixtures, the debris in alleys, the flaking paint and rusty gutters, the heavy locks and sagging boards: they say the same disagreeable things. What do the sightless windows see, I wonder, when the sun throws a passerby against them? Here a stair unfolds toward the street—dark, rickety, and treacherous—and I always feel, ad I pass it, that if I just went carefully up and turned the corner at the landing, I would find myself out of the world. But I’ve never had the courage.

That Same Person

The weeds catch up with Billy. In pursuit of the hollyhocks, they rise in coarse clumps all around the front of his house. Billy has to stamp down a circle by his door like a dog or cat does turning round to nest up, they’re so thick. What particularly troubles me is that winter will find the weeds still standing stiff and tindery to take the sparks which Billy’s little mortarless chimney spouts. It’s true that fires are fun here. The town whistle, which otherwise only blows for noon (and there’s no noon on Sunday), signals the direction of the fire by the length and number of its blasts, the volunteer firemen rush past in their cars and trucks, houses empty their owners along the street every time like an illustration in a children’s book. There are many bikes, too, and barking dogs, and sometimes—halleluiah—the fire’s right here in town—a vacant lot of weeds and stubble flaming up. But I’d rather it weren’t Billy or Billy’s lot or house. Quite selfishly I want him to remain the way he is—counting his sticks and logs, sitting on his sill in the soft early sun—though I’m not sure what his presence means to me…or to anyone. Nevertheless, I keep wondering whether, given time, I might not someday find a figure in out language which would serve him faithfully, and furnish his poverty and loneliness richly out.

Wires

Where sparrows sit like fists. Doves fly the steeple. In mist the wires change perspective, rise and twist. If they led to you, I would know what they were. Thoughts passing often, like the starlings who flock these fields at evening to sleep in the trees beyond, would form a family of paths like this; they’d foot down the natural height of air to just about a bird’s perch. But they do not lead to you.

Of whose beauty it was sung.
She shall make the old man young.

They fasten me.
If I walked straight on, in my present mood, I would reach the Wabash. It’s not a mood in which I’d choose to conjure you. Similes dangle like baubles from me. This time of year the river is slow and shallow, the clay banks crack in the sun, weeds surprise the sandbars. The air is moist and I am sweating. It’s impossible to rhyme in this dust. Everything—sky, the cornfield, stump, wild daisies, my old clothes and pressless feelings—seem fabricated for installment purchase. Yes. Christ. I am suffering a summer Christmas; and I cannot walk under the wires. The sparrows scatter like handfuls of gravel. Really, wires are voices in thin stripes. They are words wound in cables. Bars of connection.

Weather

I would rather it were the weather that was to blame for what I am and what my friends and neighbors are—we who live here in the heart of the country. Better the weather, the wind, the pale dying snow…the snow—why not the snow? There’s never much really, not around the lover Lakes anyway, not enough to boast about, not enough to be useful. My father tells how the snow in the Dakotas would sweep to the roofs of the barns in the old days, and he and his friends would sled on the crust that would form because the snow was so fiercely driven. In Bemidji trees have been known to explode. That would be something—if the trees in Davenport or Francisville or Carbondale or Niles were to do blam some winter—blam! blam! blam! All the way down the gray, cindery, snow-sick streets.
A cold fall rain is blackening the trees or the air if like lilac and full of parachuting seeds. Who cares to live in any season but his own? Still I suspect the secret’s in this snow, the secret of our sickness, if we could only diagnose it, for we are all dying like the elms of Urbana. This snow—like our skin it covers the country. Later dust will do it. Right now—snow. Mud presently. But it is snow without any laughter in it, a pale gray pudding thinly spread on stiff toast, and if that seems a strange description, it’s accurate all the same. Of course soot blackens everything, but apart from that, we are never sufficiently cold here. The flakes as they come, alive and burning, we cannot retain, for if our temperatures fall, they rise promptly again, just as, in the summer, they bob about in the same feckless way. Suppose though…suppose they were to rise some August, climb and rise, and then hang in the hundreds like a hawk through December, what a desert we could make of ourselves—from Chicago to Cairo, from Hammond to Columbus—what beautiful Death Valleys.

Place

I would rather it were the weather. It drives us in upon ourselves—an unlucky fate. Of course there is enough to stir our wonder anywhere; there’s enough to love, anywhere, if one is strong enough, if one is diligent enough, if one is perceptive, patient, kind enough—whatever it takes; and surely it’s better to live in the country, to live on a prairie by a drawing of rivers, in Iowa or Illinois or Indiana, say, than in any city, in any stinking fog of human beings, in any blooming orchard of machines. It ought to be. The cities are swollen and poisonous with people. It ought to be better. Man has never been a fit environment for man—for rats, maybe, rats do nicely, or for dogs or cats and the household beetle.
And how long the street is, nowadays. These endless walls are fallen to keep back the tides of earth. Brick could be beautiful but we have covered it gradually with gray industrial vomits. Age does not make concrete genial, and asphalt is always—like America—twenty-one, until it breaks up in crumbs like stale cake. The brick, the asphalt, the concrete, the dancing signs and garish posters, the feed and excrement of the automobile, the litter of its inhabitants, they compose, they decorate, they line our streets, and there is nowhere, nowadays, our streets can’t reach.
A man in the city has no natural thin by which to measure himself. His parks are plotted plants. Nothing can live and remain free where he resides but the pigeon, starling, sparrow, spider, cockroach, mouse, moth, fly, and weed, and he laments the existence of even these and makes his plans to poison them. The zoo? There is the zoo. Through its bard the city man stares at the great cats and dully sucks his ice. Living, alas, among men and their marvels, the city man supposes that his happiness depends on establishing somehow, a special kind of harmonious accord with others. The novelists of the city, of slums and crowds, they call it love—and break their pens.
Wordsworth feared the accumulation of men in cities. He foresaw their “degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation,” and some of their hunger for love. Living in a city, among so many, dwelling in the heat and tumult of incessant movement, a man’s affairs are touch and go—that’s all. It’s not surprising that the novelists of the slums, the cities, and the crowds, should find that sex is but a scratch to ease a tickle, that we’re most human when we’re sitting on the john, and that the justest image of our life is in full passage through the plumbing

That man, immur’d in cities, still retains
His inborn inextinguishable thirst
Of rural scenes, compensating his loss
By supplemental shifts, the best he may.

Come into the country, then. The air numbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses. Here, growling tractors tear the earth. Dust rolls up behind them. Drivers sit jouncing under bright umbrellas. They wear refrigerated hats and steer by looking at the tracks they’ve cut behind them, their transistors blaring. Close to the land, are they? good companions  to the soil? Tell me: do they live in harmony with the alternating seasons?
It’s a life of old poetry. The modern husbandman uses chemicals from cylinders and sacks, spike-ball-and-claw machines, metal sheds, and cost accounting. Nature in the old sense does not matter. It does not exist. Our farmer’s only mystical attachment is to parity. And id he does not realize that cows and corn are simply different kinds of chemical engine, he cannot expect to make a go of it.
It isn’t necessary to suppose our cows have feelings; our neighbor haven’t as many as he used to have either; but think of it this way a moment, you can correct for the human imputations later: how would it feel to nurse those strange tentacled calves with their rubber, glass, and metal lips, their stainless eyes?

People

Aunt Pet’s still able to drive her car—a high square Ford—even though she walks with difficulty and a stout stick. She has a watery gaze, a smooth plump face despite her age, and jet black hair in a bun. She has the slowest smile of anyone I ever saw, but she hates dogs, and not very long ago cracked the back of one she cornered in her garden. To prove her vigor she will tell you this, her smile breaking gently while she raises the knob of her stick to the level of your eyes.

House, My Breath and Window

My window is a grave, and all that lies within it’s dead. No snow is falling. There’s no haze. It is not still, not silent. Its images are not an animal that waits, for movement is no demonstration. I have seen the sea slack, life bubble through a body without a trace, its spheres impervious as soda’s. Downwound, the whore at wagtag clicks and clacks. Leaves wiggle. Grass sways. A bird chirps, pecks the ground. An auto wheel in penning circles keeps its rigid spokes. These images are stones; they are memorials. Beneath this sea lies sea: god rest it…rest the world beyond my window, me in front of my reflection, above this page, my shade. Death is not so still, so silent, since silence implies a falling quiet, stillness a stopping, containing, holding in: for death is time in a clock, like Mr. Tick, electric…like wind through a windup poet. And my blear floats out to visible against the glass, befog its country and bespill myself. The mist lifts slowly from the fields in the morning. No one noe would say: the Earth throws back its covers; it is rising from sleep. Why is the feeling foolish? The image is too Greek. I used to gaze at you so wantonly your body blushed. Imagine: wonder: that my eyes could cause such flowering. Ah, my friend, your face is pale, the weather cloudy; a street has been felled through your chin, bare trees do nothing, houses take root in their rectangles, a steeple stands up in your head. You speak of loving; then give me a kiss. The pane is cold. On icy mornings the fog rises to greet me (as you always did); the barns and other buildings, rather than ghostly, seem all the more substantial for looming, as if they grew in themselves while I watched (as you always did). Oh my approach, I suppose, was like breath in a rubber monkey. Nevertheless, on the road along the Wabash in the morning, through the trees are sometimes obscured by fog, their reflection floats serenely on the river, reasoning the banks, the sycamores in French rows. Magically, the world tips. I'm led to think that only those who grow down live (which will scarcely win me twenty-five from Wisdom's Monthly Digest), but I find I write that only those who live down grow; and what I write, I hold, whatever I really know. My every word's inverted, or reversed- or I am. I held you, too, that way. You were so utterly provisional, subject to my change. I could inflate your bosom with a kiss, disperse your skin with gentleness, enter your vagina from within, and make my love emerge like a fresh sex. The pane is cold. Honesty is cold, my inside lover. The sun looks, through the mist, like a plum on the tree of heaven, or a bruise on the slope of your belly. Which? The grass crawls with frost. We meet on this window, the world and I, inelegantly, swimmers of the glass; and swung wrong way round to one another, the world seems in. The world- how grand, how monumental, grave and deadly, that word is: the world, my house, and poetry. All poets have their inside lovers. Wee penis does not belong to me, or any of this foggery. It is his property which he's thrust through what's womanly of me to set down this. These wooden houses in their squares, gray streets, and fallen sidewalks, standing trees, your name I've written sentimentally across my breath into the whitening air, pale birds: they exist in me now because of him. I gazed with what intensity... A bush in the excitement of its roses could not have bloomed so beautifully as you did then. It was a look I'd like to give this page. For that is poetry: to bring within about, to change.

Politics

Sports, politics, and religion are the three passions of the badly educated. They are the Midwest's open sores. Ugly to see, a source of constant discontent, they sap the body's strength. Appalling quantities of money, time, and energy are wasted on them. The rural mind is narrow, passionate, and reckless on those matters. Greed, however shortsighted and direct, will not alone account for it. I have known men, for instance, who for years have voted squarely against their interests. Nor have I ever noticed that their surly Christian views prevented them from urging forward the smithereening, say, of Russia, China, Cuba, or Korea. And they tend to back their country like they back their local team: they have a fanatical desire to win; yelling is their forte; and if things go badly, they are inclined to sack the coach. All in all, Birch is a good name. It stands for the bigot's stick, the wild-child-tamer's cane.
Forgetfulness- is that their object?
Oh, I was new, I thought. A fresh start: new cunt, new climate, and new country- there you were, and I was pioneer, and had no history. That language hurts me, too, my dear. You'll never hear it.

Education

Has a quarter disappeared from Paula Frosty's pocket book? Imagine the landscape of that face: no crayon could engender it; soft wax is wrong; thin wire in trifling snips might do the trick. Paula Frosty and Christopher Roger accuse the pale and splotchy Cheryl Pipes. But Miss Jakes, I saw her. Miss Jakes is so extremely vexed she snaps her pencil. What else is missing? I appoint you a detective, John: search her desk. Gum, candy, paper, pencils, marble, round eraser--whose? A thief. I can't watch her all the time, I'm here to teach. Poor pale fossetted Cheryl, it's determined, can't return the money because she took it home and spent it. Cindy, Janice, John, and Pete--you four who sit around her--you four who sit around her--you will be detectives this whole term again. I'll handle you, she cried. To think. A thief. In all my years. Then shewrites on the blackboard the name of Cheryl Pipes and beneath that the figure twenty-five with a large sign for cents. Now Cheryl, she says, this won't be taken off until you bring that money out of home, out of home straight up to here, Miss Jake says, tapping her desk.
Which is three days.

Another Person

I was raking leaves when Uncle Halley introduced himself to me. He said his name came from the comet, and that his mother had borne him prematurely in her fright of it. I thought of Hobbes, whom fear of the Spanish Armada had hurried into birth, and so I believed Uncle Halley to honor the philosopher, though Uncle Halley is a liar, and neither the one hundred twenty-nine nor the fifty-three he ought to be. That fall the leaves had burned themselves out on the trees, the leaf lobes had curled, and now they flocked noisily down the street and were broken in the wires of my rake. Uncle Halley was himself (like Mrs. Desmond and history generally) both deaf and implacable, and he shooed me down his basement stairs to a room set aside there for stacks of newspapers reaching to the ceiling, boxes of leaflets and letters and programs, racks of photo albums, scrapbooks, bundles of rolled-up posters and maps, flags and pennants and slanting piles of dusty magazines devoted mostly to monitoring and the Christian ethic. I saw a bird cage, a tray of butterflies, a bugle, a stiff straw boater, and all kinds of tassels tied to a coat tree. He still possessed and had on display the steering lever from his first car, a linen duster, driving gloves and goggles, photographs along the wall of himself, his friends, and his various machines, a shell from the first war, a record of ""Ramona"" nailed through its hole to a post, walking sticks and fanciful umbrellas, shoes of all sorts (his baby shoes, their counters broken, were held in sorrow beneath my nose--they had not been bronzed, but he might have them done someday before he died, he said), countless boxes of medals, pins, beads, trinkets, toys, and keys (I scarcely saw--they flowed like jewels from his palms), pictures of downtown when it was only a path by the railroad station, a brightly colored globe of the world with a dent in Poland, antique guns, belt buckles, buttons, souvenir plates and cups and saucers (I can't remember all of it--i Won't), but I recall hoe shamefully, how rudely, how abruptly, I fled, a good story in my mouth but death in my nostrils; and hoe afterward I busily, righteously, burned my leaves as if I were purging the world of its years. I still wonder if this town--its life, and mine now--isn't really a record like the one of ""Ramona"" that I used to crank around on my grandmother's mahogany Victrola through lonely rainy days as a kid.

The First Person

Billy's like the coal he's found: spilled, mislaid, discarded. The sky's no comfort. His house and his body are dying together. His windows are boarded. And now he's reduced to his hands. I suspect he has glaucoma. At any rate he can scarcely see, and weeds his yard of rubble on his hands and knees. Perhaps he's a surgeon cleansing a wound or an ardent and tactile lover. I watch, I must say, apprehensively. Like mine-war detectors, his hands graze in circles ahead of him. Your nipples were the color of your eyes. Pebble. Snarl of paper. Length of twine. He leans down closely, picks up something silvery, holds it hear his nose. Foil? cap? coin? He has within him--what, I wonder? Does he know more now because he fingers everything and has to sniff to see? It would be romantic cruelty to think so. He bends the down on your arms like a breeze. You wrote me; something is strange when we don't understand. I write in return: I think when I loved you I fell to my death.
Billy, I could read to you from Beddoes; he's your man perhaps; he held with dying, freed his blood of its arteries; and he said that there were many wretched love-ill fools like me lying alongside the last bone of their former selves, as full of spirit and speech, nonetheless, as Mrs. Desmond, Uncle Halley and the Ferris wheel, Aunt Pet, Miss Jakes, Ramona or the megaphone; yet i reverse him finally, Billy, on no evidence but braggadocio, and I declare that though my inner organs were devoured long ago, the worm which swallowed down my parts still throbs and glows like a crystal palace.
Yes, you were younger. I was Uncle Halley, the museum man and infrequent meteor. Here is my first piece of ass. They weren't so flat in those days, had more round, more juice. And over here's the sperm I've spilled, nicely jarred and clearly labeled. Look at this tape like lengths of intestine where i've stored my spew, the endless worm of words I've written, a hundred million emissions or more: oh I was quite a man right from the start; even when unconscious in my cradle, from crotch to cranium, I was erectile tissue; though mostly, after the manner approved by Plato, I had intercourse by eye. Never mind, old Holsclaw, you are blind. We pull down darkness when we go to bed; put out like Oedipus the actually offending organ, and train our touch to lies. All cats are gray, says Mr. Tick; so under cover of glaucoma you are a sack gray too, and cannot be distinguished from a stallion.
I must pull myself together, get a grip, just as they say, but I feel spilled, bewildered, quite mislaid. I did not restore my house to its youth, but to its age. Hunting, you hitch through the hollyhocks. I'm inclined to say you aren't half the cripple I am, for there is nothing left of me but mouth. However, i resist the impulse, It is another lie of poetry. My organs are all there, though it's there where I fail--at the roots of my experience. Poetry, like love, is--in and out--a physical caress. I can't tolerate any more of my sophistries about spirit, mind, and breath. Body equals being, and if your weight goes down, you are the less.

Household Apples

I knew nothing about apples. Why should I? My country came in my childhood, and I dreamed of sitting among the blooms like the bees. I failed to spray the pear tree too. I doubled up under them at first, admiring the sturdy low branches I should have pruned, and later I acclaimed the blossoms. Shortly after the fruit formed there were falls--not many--apples the size of goodish stones which made me wobble on my ankles when I walked about the yard. Sometimes a piece crushed by a heel would cling on the shoe to track the house. I gathered a few and heaved them over the wires. A slingshot would have been splendid. Hard, an unattractive green, the worms had them. Before long I realized the worms had them all. Even as the apples reddened, lit their tree, they were being swallowed. The birds preferred the pears, which were small--sugar pears I think they're called--with thick skins of graying green that ripen on toward violet. So the fruit fell, and once I made some applesauce by quartering and paring hundreds; but mostly I did nothing, left them, until suddenly, overnight it seemed, in that ugly late September heat we often have in Indiana, my problem was upon me.
My childhood came in the country. I remember, now, the flies on our snowy luncheon table. As we cleared away they would settle, fastidiously scrub themselves and stroll to the crumbs to feed where I would kill them in crowds with a swatter. It was quite a game to catch them taking off. I struck heavily since I didn't mind a few stains; they'd wash. The swatter was a square of screen bound down in red cloth. It drove no air ahead of it to give them warning. The faint pink dot where they had died did not rub out as I'd supposed, and after years of use our luncheon linen would faintly, pinkly, speckle.
The country became my childhood. Flies braided themselves on the flypaper in my grandmother's house. I can smell the bakery and the grocery and the stables and the dairy in that small Dakota town I knew as a kid; knew as I dreamed I'd know your body, as I've known nothing, before or since; knew as the flies knew, in the honest, unchaste sense: the burned house, hose-wet, which drew a mist of insects like the blue smoke of its smolder, and gangs of boys, moist-lipped, destructive as its burning. Flies have always impressed me; they are so persistently alive. Now they were coating the ground beneath my trees. Some were ordinary flies; there were the large blue-green ones; there were swarms of fruit flies too, and the red-spotted scavenger beetle; there were a few wasps, several sorts of bees and butterflies—checkers, sulphurs, monarchs, commas, question marks—and delicate dragonflies…but principally houseflies and horseflies and bottleflies, flies and more flies in clusters around the rotting fruit. They loved the pears. Inside, they fed. If you picked up a pear, they flew, and the pear became skin and stem. They were everywhere the fruit was: in the tree still—apples like a hive for them—or where the fruit littered the ground, squashing itself as you stepped…there was no help for it. The flies droned, feasting on the sweet juice. No one could go near the trees; I could not climb; so I determined at last to labor like Hercules. There were fruit baskets in the barn. Collecting them and kneeling under the branches, I began to gather remains. Deep in the strong rich smell of the fruit, I began to hum myself. The fruit caved in at the touch. Glistening red apples, my lifting disclosed, had families of beetles, flies, and bugs, devouring their rotten undersides. There were streams of flies; there were lakes and cataracts and rivers of flies, seas and oceans. The hum was heavier, higher, than the hum of the bees when they came to the blooms in the spring, though the bees were there, among the flies, ignoring me—ignoring everyone. As my work went on and juice covered my hands and arms, they would form a sleeve, black and moving, like knotty wool. No caress could have been more indifferently complete. Still I rose fearfully, ramming my head in the branches, apples bumping against me before falling, bursting with bugs. I’d snap my hand sharply but the flies would cling to the sweet. I could toss a whole cluster into a basket from several feet. As the pear or apple lit, they would explosively rise, like monads for a moment, windowless, certainly, with respect to one another, sugar their harmony. I had to admit, though, despite my distaste, that my arm had never been more alive, oftener or more gently kissed. Those hundreds of feet were light. In washing them off, I pretended the hose was a pump. What have I missed? Childhood is a lie of poetry.

The Church

Friday night. Girls in dark skirts and white blouses sit in tanks and scream in concert. They carry funnels loosely stuffed with orange and black paper which they shake wildly, and small megaphones through which, as drilled, they direct and magnify their shouting. Their leaders, barely pubescent girls, prance and shake and whirl their skirts above their bloomers. The young men, leaping, extend their arms and rave through the puddles of amber light, their bodies glistening. In a lull, though it rarely occurs, you can hear the squeak of tennis shoes against the floor. Then the yelling begins again, and then continues; fathers, mothers, neighbors joining in to form a single pulsing ululation—a cry of the whole community—for in this gymnasium each body becomes the bodies beside it, pressed as they are together, thigh to thigh, and the same shudder runs through all of them, and runs toward the same release. Only the ball moves serenely through this dazzling din. Obedient to law it scarcely speaks but caroms quietly and lives at peace.

Business

It is the week of Christmas and the stores, to accommodate the rush they hope for, are remaining open in the evening. You can see the show falling in the cones of the street lamps. The roads are filling—undisturbed. Stings of red and green lights droop over the principal highway, and the water tower wears a star. The windows of the stores have been bedizened. Shamelessly they beckon. But I am alone, leaning against a pole—no…there is no one in sight. They’re all at home, perhaps by their instruments, tuning in on their evenings, and like Ramona, tirelessly playing and replaying themselves. There’s a speaker perched in the tower, and through the boughs of falling snow and over the vacant streets, it drapes the twisted and metallic strains of a tune that can barely be distinguished—yes, I believe it’s one of the jolly ones, it’s “Joy to the World.” There’s no one to hear the music but myself, and though I’m listening, I’m no longer certain. Perhaps the record’s playing something else.1Embed",country

There's going to be a battle the lines have been drawn

There's war after war and rumors of war from the east

Good mothers cry cause the rivers run high
With the blood of too many sons

Does he search for contentment that he might hope to find

And lovin' the cowboy ways
Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes
I burned up my childhood days
I learned of all the rules of the modern-day drifter
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long
Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them
With the words of a sad country song
My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams

Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
From being alone too long
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
Knowin' well that your best days are gone
Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen
I let the words of my years fade away
Old worn-out saddles, and old worn-out memories
With no one and no place to stay

Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail

And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name and freight yards full of old Black men
And the graveyards full of rusted automobiles

Say, don't you know me? I'm your native son

Dealing cards with the old man in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keeping score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumbling 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rocking to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

You were the only girl I wanted to know
You didn't accept me right away

So don't pretend I'll disappear
Cause I'm bringing you a love that's so sincere
I've got your best interests at heart
There's no sense in us being apart
Look back over your shoulder
And I'll be there, I'm always here
Look back over your shoulder
Anywhere you can check
I know you think I'm just a flirt
But you're so wrong and I'm easily hurt
My ambitions all include you
Sharing in all our whole life through
Won't you take me seriously
Open up your eyes and try to see
No other guy could love you more
Than you've ever been loved before
Look back over your shoulder
And I'll be there, I'm always here
Look back over your shoulder
Anywhere you can check
I don't want to play second fiddle
Don't let me feelings be torn in two
I don't wanna be caught in the middle
Gimme a chance to really love you
Look back over your shoulder
And I'll be there, I'm always here
Look back over your shoulder
Anywhere you can check
If you think you'll find another man
Ask yourself can he do what I can
Would he wish for you sunshine everyday
Would he try to make the tears go away
If he leaves you in a state of shock
I'll still be here silent as a rock

Your fate is to spend your life with me

Two households both alike in dignity
In fair Verona where we lay our scene
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents strife
The fearful passage of their death marked love
And the continuance of their parents rage
Which, but their children's end, naught could remove
Is now the two hours traffic of our stage
The which if you with patient ears attend
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend
Shall strive to mend

Romeo, now suddenly your heart is burning
Romeo, and in her eyes the stars are shining
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo

Juliet, your heart is torn tween love and hatred
Juliet, but love so sweet came unexpected

And young affection gapes to be his heir
That fair for which love groaned for and would die
With tender Juliet matched, is now not fair
Now Romeo is beloved, and loves again
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks
But to his foe supposed he must complain
And she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new beloved anywhere
But passion lends them power, time means to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet

disco.00020.wav,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me ""Patches""
Papa used to tease me about it
'Course deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the time got bad

The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said
He said:

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""

Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was daddy's strictest rule
You might also likeSo every morning fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home

But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said:

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through

'Cause every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me

Every night I heard my mama pray:
""Lord, give him strength to make another day""
Though years have passed and all the kids have grown
The angels took mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin':

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""

Oh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin':

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""

I could still hear papa when he's saying:

""Patches, I'm depending on you, son

I never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core
It says, ""turn around you fool
You know you love him more and more""
Tell me why is it so
Don't want to let you go

Hey, I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh baby, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, hey

Three tried, three gone, it's the same ol' song (What? What?)

Recline like recedin' hairline (Ha), crime speaks fine (Ah)

When I step up in your jam (Uh), yo, I'm V.I.P
Niggas and bitches be eyein' me (Woo), I'm spontaneous
I'm wreckin' brothers out the frame, because I'm dangerous (Uhh)

Chickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile (*beeping*)
I'm great distance like AT&T (T)
I stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee (Yeah)
Yo, I fades them all like my man Mally G
Whip a nigga ass for free (Yeah) and makin' sure he see visions of me (Uh, uh!)

Ask Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors
My technique I freak (Uh) seven days a week
I'm undefeated (Yeah), you can see my Quantum Leap (Uh)
I'm hittin' brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert
Those who got no publishin', they need to get jerked (No doubt)
A hundred percent, I gets down what I invent
Rap artists be dyin' to a certain extent (Woo)
Sometimes they use the underground to make a comeback
That shit is wack (Wack), fade away and never come back!

[Verse 5: Lord Have Mercy]
For now and forever, it's thy evil that men do
Mental, my inner center Winter
Frosted froze crews inventor, inventor!
Invader! Evacuate, I collapse your major
Straights and loose minds (Ohh), you splits two times
For intruders, for these losers, my maneuvers
Drop like lugers, illegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's
Splittin blessings with three Weapons
Lay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin' the nine-six
For you mindless niggas I smack spineless
Or lay back like recliners, as inject jewels
As flesh, moves, when in vaginas, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Corrupt your minors like New York City's finest!
Lineups, on LSD fine dust, in your sinus!
Crush like chinas, oopiu MC grinders
My dust, these rhymers I hijack like airliners! (Uh!)
The infiltrator, creator (Yeah!), I'm sinful
Papers stay viscous like religious cults
Leaders that drop scriptures and rock clips or assault heaters
My Flipmode niggas! We're like Afghanistan guerillas

[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]
If you want more information, look, listen and read
While I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed
We about to take control of your set like cruise control speed
Satisfy my lyrical semen (Ha), plants my Johnny Apple-seed, now
Mental slave grip on your brain like white people (Ha)
My music will dominate the population like black people!
Utilize my efforts to exercise my inner thoughts
I capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts (Sorts, sorts, sorts, sorts, sorts...)
Hold down the forts, smokin' (Ha), drinkin' mad quarts (Quarts)
For sports (Ha), talk to chickenheads in botty lik shorts (Wooo)
Let's get the cream, so that we can move up in this fortress (Haa)
Bounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits
Here we go again, another phenomenon when I get on (Ha)
Busta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong (Stretch Armstrong)
We represent the ultimate unit for the nine seasons
Flipmode Squad (Ha) will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons (Word is bond)
Chaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down (Ha)
'Til we come through like the ATF and shut your shit down (Ha)
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is how we movin'
Raw rapid fire flows, while the music keeps you niggas groovin' (Hoo!)
I don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin'
You're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin'
From your conversation, the way you come across your shit is off
Malfunctionin', my nigga, you about to feel the real force (Ha)
Lay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross
Exotic niggas blastin' off to the Land of the Lost
If you can't see this, I recommend some school (Ooh, hoo, ha) for the blind by Helen Keller (Keller, ha)
Big ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas
Redman and the Rockafellas (Woo!)
Big ups to Mally G, Keith Murray, sunny days and bad weathers (Hahaha)

The stream went out for two hours, you see how that shit play out?
This nigga SMACK tryna vault my shit before it came out!
Everybody here, it’s Volume 2, right?
I need y’all to take out ya notes, we at the trap house again
I moved weight out da do', I weighed out the dope
But this time it’s that block work, straight outta boat
First I bagged Twork and now I gotta break down an O
So who we got?
Somebody to Get fly, on cam?
I’m gripping shit with both hands bitch it look like I brang out a drone
You look like you doing bad & you ain’t gotta phone
I’m from where they can’t post bail, so they take out them loans
And hold da white down harder than Raven-Symone
Whats up boy?
Everybody out here flagging? I don’t know
But True Colors gon get exposed Red and you a Tai Bo hoe
We don’t measure on any scale, so how does this add up???
But over time it’s gon’ show
You come up short... ohh, don’t nobody wanna eye ball O!!!
What's up boy? You better ball up, call up for May Day, aye
Cause we out here on them blocks and everyday they ain’t
Act “Trippy ... RED” beefin' with the Trey Way/Wait Wait
I’ll put the hood on red necks (next) like da KKK!!!!
Who killin' shit, I'm swinging the pendulum, move militant
I see it in your eyes Red! You innocent
Got all these sports bars, yeah, he’s ignorant
How you reppin' Jersey but make the league minimum?
Nah don’t ignore that Red, see this is all facts Red
Cigar smoke on Court/Cort'; it ain’t Auerbach, RED
My respect! My top tier, I want it all back Red
You a D League, 10 day contract Red!
And ever since I did the salsa, chacha n bachata
The ese’s in the jail been screaming ""Viva La Rassa!""
Papa, got me a chopper & it go ""Rah Rah""
Mira Pendejo, prieto... no me joda aqui en mi casa
Oh Y’all want that Translation...
So that’s what’s owed to the fans?
Y'all should know I’m Puerto Rican, bitch I like to talk wit my hands!
Big B’s, I make lunch, I hit his cheek the blade drawn
We split screens, remain calm, bitch please
Play dumb? We spray bombs; sixteen
Raise one like teenage moms
I’m talking log jams, over the border it get across fam'
I’m insured to scheme over plates, it ain’t a car Scam!!
Big eight, make no mistake, you see the arms fam'?
Think Drake! You All Get Bucks, This Is Gods Plan!!!
You mad motherfuckin’ fèo
And yo life is a no go, O
Plus you got exposed for kissing hoes after sucking off the bro’s
Whoa that’s a no no, O!
Manonono monono mononono.....
Translation: WHEN IT COME TO BITCHES, YOU'RE A BOZO, O!!!!!!
Look at me tho', I ain’t lackin’
Look at Red suited for a Thriller, but I ain’t jack it (jacket)
Oh y'all hoping that O won?
Already he down 0-1
The clip drawn, a hit of da bong, it rip his whole lung
The Semi burst, cursed, the flame spark; hold one!
It “crack heads”, first name, Lamar.... ODOM (O dumb)
You’s a sucka, a child, hot air balloons
That means one flame from this pump will lift him up to the clouds
It’s funny how I air shit out, but it still leaves you under the ground
It’s like Vegas when I spray shit, why?
Cause all y’all gon catch one in da crowd
And you the next man to lay... bae too
Oh that was hard...you get it
Mandalay Bay?
Huh! That’s a bar
Then crack a jack (Cracker Jack) at ya bae roof (Babe Ruth)
No that’s a bar
For candy wrappers, candy clappers, burst two
Think Urkel, bitch Family Matters
Don't get ya torso Kriss Kross til it look like you standing backwards
Them bullets make U-turn...when they run through Red like ambulances
So like I said I appreciate you reaching out
But wait ‘til round 3 cause there’s some shit we gotta speak about!

Smack what you be on?
This a lose lose tell this faggot move along
A lose lose for you I mean, you see
I could snap and do you wrong
Or choke every round and send you back where you belong
My whole squad turn into Ford
Choppers and the 4's
Clip full of bad apples, we ridin' (rotten) to the Cor'
I got my .30 cocked
With the extended clip it's a 30 shot
30 .30 pop, then Cor' up like a dirty cop
I told Smack, ""Pay me and 'Tez can die tonight, son.""
For a check, I leave Cor' wrecked (correct): you got the right one
Smack White, you know how I damage work
Ernesto? Premature ejaculator:
He couldn't even handle Twork
But he asking for me, knowing that I'mma chalk him out
You like that nigga that co-workers be talkin' bout
Who want his last strike, but him and the boss be fallin' out
In other words I'm the wrong one to be callin' out
Drive by, I make a movie scene when the Uzi sing
Put a round in a pussy, watch how you maneuvering (Nuva Ring)
Out the Caddy V, if 'Tez junior where daddy be
I let the [?] shots Nick Young-in' like Swaggy P
Think you the target when I aim it and pull it, not at all
It's for your son
I wrote his name on the bullets I just cock it and have a flock of these spawn
Clip loaded with bagels; That's a bunch of rounds with papi seed on it
Between me and you, your mother is a whore
She can cook, clean and suck a nugget through a straw
I love me a young thot, but they got nothin' on that slaw
That bitch handle the D like a Dunkin' Donuts door
She nasty!
What you ain't feeling it Aak?
You don't like it when I brag about me hitting her box
I don't give a fuck nigga get hot
I'm lifting the Glock
Hypothermia: I bet you core (Cor') temperature drop
Shot poppin', you bust in your mother room, without knockin'
This shot strapped for the cock blockin'
That dike bitch who be wit him jump out of the side pocket
I'm puttin' Ms Fit on a shirt like Hot Topics
Shit'll get graphic
Close range banging the clips
Two grips breaking her shit
If you got something to say to that bitch
You better head to the mall after these torches melt her
He don't get it?
BAOW! Meet her by the Lord and tell her
Murder Ave Gang? You niggas ain't killed shit
You got one Ms Fit in ya clique and it's a bitch
Ya homies? Soft, Cor': cable with the porn flicks
China men ear, the pussies get lifted with long sticks
Pull a nigga card quick, on some Yugi shit with the doolie disc
Hooligan, known for the mac like Max Julien
The toolie lift
Motherfuck bein' dubious
I'll clap a bull, 'matic pull
Right at 'em, Cor'...fuck up his nucleus!
I got this shit down to a science
You standin' there tryin' to battle me like you can be anything but a casualty!
Ain't no way in Hell this Latin out-rappin' me
I spit savagely, Cortez can never rattle me
That (*sniff*) all in my pen: I'm Zeke off of The Faculty!
I even got aliens tweekin' out, I know you see the clout
Aye Twork bro, I'll creep in this Puerto Rican house
Reach in his pregnant bitch pussy, on that [?] snatch back now she a [?] that mean the feet is (fetus) out
I caught Cor' on the back porch, he was sneakin' out
I'll pull the heater out then point it right at his freakin' scalp
Try to grab the strap BAOW BAOW
That's for reachin' out
After the third BAOW BAOW there ain't shit we gotta speak about
Jersey
[Round 2: Cortez]
That rap was cute....
But fuck that bitch if I clap a few
I’ll give him 11 to his back now let’s see what this MAC’ll do (McAdoo)
This the round where I ain’t playing wit cha
You and ya mans, casket to casket, they'll be laying witcha
Cut the games I’ll lay hands and feet on Red, we playing Twister
I catch Red wit his bitch, plot on they jewels
I'm cockin’ the tool
“Ayo Cor’ that’s his wifey!”
Ayo Smack I don't give a fuck if that bitch move
You know I’m poppin' her too
I ain’t wanna Diss O bae (disobey), but hey
That bitch best to follow the rules
You gon die as usual
Big drum, bangin' in concert
I wave sticks like I do musicals
One hits at his bitch like, “Psst....ma you beautiful”
And it’ll suit (shoot) up Red like Piru funerals
He can't breathe, Carlito style now you’s can’t leave
I lick a (Liquor) cold shot, straight to the head...yeah it’s brain freeze
I do dirt then change tee’s, for hood rats, my dame, grease
So you respect this “side bitch” or my “main squeeze”
I heard ya man Cal talking crazy, Smack that’s minor
I know only doing it cause I’m lit and my raps finer
But I dunno who sucking dick worse though, him or Blac Chyna
And when it comes to Surf
You can’t even mention his name to Smack tho
Like you ain’t realize I got fat yo
So why you keep feeding me snacks though???
You told me he ""Lit” and I want “smoke” with anybody tryna roll up to back O (tobacco)
Oh JC said that?
That's great cause I got lines that go back to back O
Here’s a Hollow for anybody in da back to back O
Now that’s how you bring an Arsonal back to back, O!!!
Yeah boy hookah bars, I blow in da mist
Rounds cold (coal), so whoever want “smoke” get a “tip""
I get em tossed in da air for acting all rowdy
Pom poms and cheerleadin' but Smack, I’m the one that's catching a body!
I draw on this crown, shots crop his top
I’ll paint the streets wit Red, I’ll Basquiat ya block
Boy the sofrito hijo, let da chef cook
I’m from Murda Ave, but since i couldn’t Murda, Ave
Then fuck it I’m giving Red Hooks!
Volume 2 right, I told you Red, this ya best look
You gotta push from the fans on court (Cort') you think you Westbrook
But I’m da best out, head hunting
BAOW I'm taking head counts
So either check in or get checked out
I’ll hit him with X amount, he’ll be X’d Out
Malcolm X style
Meaning he gon’ burn & then die (dye) when I let it fry on Red scalp
This “Card, Key”, for small rooms and they just checked you in
To Cort' (court) yeard
So resort to the mess you in
You spent Days Inn that cell?
Cool, I’ll still get you sent, hit his Crowne and find Comfort pushing Red Roof in
But let this ho tell (hotel) it, it’s gas, they fuelin' the engine
I move wit' discretion, rude with aggression
All cause I ain’t viewed as a legend
Ruger my weapon
Pow! Pow!
With two in ya section
Who got the app, Smack? Let’s see if he can Uber to heaven
I don’t cringe cause you awful
Boy it's not an issue to off you
Cause everything spit from the orals fixin' to chalk you
I spit shit vivid, ya image cynic, I can cripple & corpse you
Then mission abort you
We shouldn’t even speak cause God’s don’t mingle with mortals!
What? I gotta break it down
You don’t see O Red?
I’m BORED! Don’t nobody be B.O-Red
I'm hunting wit' heat, so quit the fronting to me
O don’t hold no weight, that boy like the tare button to me
So if you talking real sick, then I'm offing ya clique
It’s multiple sclerosis bitch
That means everywhere I go, I gotta walk with the sticks!
So try it fast, he gon' die when the iron blast
Then slide out da hood on da low, like a hoe tryna hide her past
Shits real & I’m gon’ supply the tags and you gon' pay the price for that
Man purse
That means a long strap on the side with that MK its all Gucci Smack
Now that’s how you design a (designer) bar
And like I said, I appreciate you reachin' out
But wait til round three, there's some shit we gotta speak about
[Round 2: O-Red]
In that first round I was dancin' on Cort': ""Half Man Half Amazin""
Second round you was fightin' back
This cat was blazin'
You was snappin' baby
Usually you be rappin' basic
Which one of y'all gave Cor' a line (Coraline) this bitch animated
I expected basic Ernesto, you know the one who told John John
""It's ironic this blind fuck ain't see this comin'""
First of all, when you blind as fuck you don't see shit comin'
That ain't irony
So the bar type wack
The irony is you havin' a smart ass mouth sayin' bars like that
Now me on the other hand, I'm the type to say some sensible shit

A head shot turn that bird brain to a shirt stain
But fuck you, let me talk to that Verb lame
I saw that Jersey poll that you made bro
In case you forgot, Ars was slumpin' you dirty
You ran off stage in Detroit cause you was duckin' the 30
And after what Twork 'bout to do, you ain't fuckin' wit' Jersey
Your Shine battle tell it all: you ain't got nothin' on jersey
The last nigga you bodied was...

You coulda took that chain and went on a long run stupid
You threw it, now it's a wrap for the chicken and cheese: Cor' done (Cordon) blew (bleu) it

He hatin' now, talkin' through my amazin' round
That's how you take a clown and break him down

Hybrid boxer I'm half Mayweather and half Tyson
Jab right him jackknife him and let the AC strike him
Leave fragments all in an esé (essay) body that's bad writing
I used to sleep with a 'volver under my pillow
All days layin' up with the spin the John Woo way
If y'all play I come to where y'all stay with a large K

He tryin' to hype some shit
And now we know how you got ya name, cause you love to ride a (Ryda) dick
Champion of the year? Yeah?

Jay Blac, Tec 9 all behind him, he's the best, right?
He beat Showoff, he had a classic wit Brizz, he’s dead nice!
The best hype
See Smack that’s why I get tight
But it’s all Gucci, I'm only here to make green off of Red stripes
They said you 1 and I was 5, is y'all peepin' the task?
It's a flashback
It's 2003 in the draft
#1 Lebron James, the man, the attraction
But you're painfully lacking and needed me
Number 5 I’m D. Wade, bitch I made you a Champion
This round it’s time I’m break down the facts with Red
If it wasn’t for that bum ass belt and for what Champion said
This battle wouldn’t even have happened Red
The fuck y'all think? You really think Smack asked for Red?
He on his 6ix9ine shit, that boy just started jacking Red!
And speaking of 6ix9ine in his face is where lead’ll be drawn
This ain’t the NBA young boy so let it be known
A Lil' Pump if the tension is on
I keep a clip, you best believe that XXX extension is on
What you think?
You Muhammad Ali, you the greatest?
Smack it’s all a lie and that’s why I gotta snatch him of his title cause “The Champion” in his prime
Be scared to go to war when the cash is (Cassius) on the line
Wordplay
Cassius, Ali, go to war
Boy I’m making it Hell cause your name ain’t ringing a bell
You ain’t gangsta, you ain’t ringing no shells
So turning Muslim’s the only way you made a name for yourself Not me tho!
The more they would hate, the more I was great
I tightened my shit up and got the formula straight
Me and you in the same boat?
Hell no, we don't sorta relate
I’m the biggest Latino in the history of battle rap and you're nothing more than #4 in your state
Dead ass!
And Twork bout to take that spot, you 'bout to be 5 my nigga
Am I lying my nigga?
He talk about tendinitis, scoliosis... (skull of yo sis)
Twork that was fire my nigga

Fuck a vault! Respect was earnt

Fuck all them niggas I don’t wanna talk unless it’s bread
They keep grillin' like him, he gon' get left for dead
BAOW! He ain’t see the TECs (text) and now his thoughts got left on read/Red
And let's talk about you versus Bigg K
Cause there's somethin' I have to address
Wait lemme pull up, Skrrt! (skirt)

Battling me bitch you best to have on a vest!

It’s Brooklyn all day I keep it trill for that
Lick a shot for PH!
The real is back!

[Round 3: O-Red]
We ain't the same Ernesto
I'm the type to look an op dead in his face while he attendin' a wake
And sleep the nigga
I ain't never been a diva nigga
You? A Jordan 11 cat, patent leather black
White top and ice bottom, I know your kind
Cor' a sneaker nigga- you pussy
You pussy...you pussy! But talk like you order hits
You softer than Dora The Explorer, Madea daughter, Cor' a (Cora) bitch
Type to shoot himself to prove to the fans he been pourin' clips
Boss nigga? You lost nigga
Check your coordinates, and it's battle rap got a problem...and we 'bout to get to the Cor' (core) of it
'Tez! You remind me of Shawn Brown with the rappin' duke
You get on cam' and say more stupid shit than Battle Truth
Example: in ya Tay Roc battle you told him you would beat him wit' the same damn gun you gave Math for Mook
Then pose like it was the illest shit
I wasn't feelin' it
Told on you and your mans, told the fans to believe you real wit' it
We call that dry snitchin'
You get killed like that
It's a code but you don't know cause you built like that
You the type, get robbed and tell them niggas ""Keep my work""
Or get locked and tell the cops, ""Whatchu need? I'll chirp.""
He ain't built for the can, he not Surf
You prolly get more bitch behind bars than the T-Top verse
Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!
You the type to be doin' some shit to look cool wit' a clique
I know a gangsta when I see one, and you is a bitch
{slight choke}
When I was out here in these streets, I was movin' with clips
When you was out here in these streets, you had to move in wit' Clips
Wait, wait, wait, wait, now I'm confused

[Charlie Clips]
Smack moved so they could see me too

[O-Red]
Now I'm confused, are y'all tellin' me, you went from Total Slaughter couch to Charlie couch?
Well goddamn Mr. Top Tier Money
You need some bread bro?
Sub Zero after the finisher, hold ya head up
BAOW! Now it's like I got evicted when the lead bust
I had the whole sidewalk covered with all that Red stuff
You don't want it wit' Red brah
I know a shooter from Atlanta; home thug
He'll let a clip bomb, whoever son call will die; Rick Grimes
No words, he wit' the shit, I'll send them to your strip slime
That rainbow wig on a Puerto Rican like 69
Two fours hit Cor' in the back Brent Grimes
Oh I take a risk on a sub mission, no [?] line
Deadbeat, he never saw the pop
Turn a Florida cop to a football ref' when he scorch ya top
The bullet I threw? Under review
Cause they don't know if it's caught or not
Y'all get it? They don't know if it's Cort' or not
I torture ops, catch him out wit' a shorty on Pizza Day
Swingin' a nine iron, no PGA
Pistol imitating Chris Brown, meanin' it's singin' ya Breezy way
Not this Puerto Rican princess; Stevie J
DNA...as far as DNA...you next
Smack set it, I got lead for him
Let's see if St. John can weather this Red Storm
I don't give a fuck how these clowns feelin'
If you give O-D on the next Volume he'll die when these rounds peel (pill)-
These rappers fishy, Smack usin' realer men to reel 'em in
Flex, Murder Ave won't like when I push your ceilin'
I give 'em six man, do you big nasty, I'm militant
Know ya roll player, 'fore they be callers; Williamson
No K's, just the pound, he get slayed, with a round
Black hearse, with a 20 car train for a clown
Think second Sunday in June before you lay in the ground
Just another Puerto Rican Day (they) Parade through the town
My squad will go to war wit' any chump
We got more ratchets than DMX second verse on What They Really Want
I'm talkin', Nina, Selena, Katrina, Sabrina
About three Kims; Latoya and Tina
Shelley, Bridget, Cathy, Rasheeda
Kelly, Nicole, Angel, Juanita
Champion Of The Year! Respect it nigga, I'm vicious
Murder Ave, huh he just rep it nigga I did, there's a difference
Look at him, he know he gettin' murked
There was no other option I had to throw him in the dirt
Second round was the eulogy, the third was the hearse
But you got bodied in round one, murder in the first
JerseyEmbed",disco
disco.00027.wav,"[Chorus: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip-hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip, hip-hop and you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 1: Wonder Mike]
Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
You see, I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello
A to the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang-bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang-bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, a but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank, come on, Hank, sing that song

[Verse 2: Big Bank Hank]
Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the wack
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money a than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again

Everybody go, ""Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go, ""Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn""
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
A Master Gee, a my mellow?
It's on you so what you gonna do?

[Verse 3: Master Gee]
Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn, you start doing the freak
I said damn, a right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
A come alive, y'all gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just a wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A singing on and on and on, on and on
Rock-rock, y'all, a get on the floor
[Chorus: Master Gee]
I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

[Post-Chorus: Master Gee]
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put the jig-jig-jiggles in your behind
I said a 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, a get on the floor
A come alive, y'all, a gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?

[Chorus: Wonder Mike]
Said a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip, hip-a-hop and you don't stop rockin'
To the bang-bang, the boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 4: Wonder Mike]
A-skiddlee bebop, we rock a scooby doo
And guess what, America, we love you
A 'cause ya rock and a roll with a so much soul
You could rock 'til you're hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we're like hot butter on a breakfast toast
We rock it up, a baby bubba
Baby bubba to the boogie, the bang-bang, the boogie
To the beat, beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody, and dance to the beat
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Wonder Mike]
A hip-hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip, hip-hop and you don't stop
A rock it out, baby bubba, to the boogie, the bang-bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat

[Verse 5: Wonder Mike]
I say I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat
An attempt to raise your body heat
A just blow your mind so a that you can't speak
A do a thing, but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on, Hank, a sing that song
A to the rhythm of the boogie, the bang-bang, the bong

[Verse 6: Big Bank Hank]
Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, a with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter, I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said ""I go by the name Lois Lane""
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit""
I said, ""You need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here and I'm there, I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
A just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, a don't stop, y'all, a tick a tock, y'all, you don't stop

[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
It go, ""Hotel, motel, a what you gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
'Cause I'm gon' get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go, ""Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn""
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

[Verse 7: Master Gee]
It was twelve o'clock a one Friday night
I was rocking to the beat and feeling alright
Everybody was dancing on the floor
Doing all the things they never did before
And then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now, the group ya hear is called Phase 2
And let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a cutting the jams and making it freak
For you to party, got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance you got to be hype
So we'll get right down and make ya rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rocking affair
But let me tell ya something, there's still one fact
That to have a party, got to have a rap
So when the party's over you're making it home
And trying to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleeping, you start to dream
And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene
A name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase 2 a just a doing the do
Rocking ya down 'cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
A come alive, girls, a get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat, to the beat, the beat
To the double beat-beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On and on until the break of dawn
Now I got a man coming on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
A come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like

[Verse 8: Wonder Mike]
I say, a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gambling fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie-bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like going up and not coming down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat, beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
A so you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull""
A so your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says, ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
But while the stinky food's steaming, your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh, so you say that's it, I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
Oh, so you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend a two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says ""I understand about the food
Baby bubba, but we're still friends""

[Chorus: Wonder Mike]
A with a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip, hip-hop and you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Post-Chorus: Wonder Mike]
I said, ""A Hank, a can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
A can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""A come on, make, m-make the people move""

[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank]
I go toot the horns and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
I'm Big Bank, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme""
So from '66 to this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you've heard
I didn't even bite, not a god**** word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat-beat y'all
A lets rock, y'all, ya don't stop

[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
It go, ""Hotel, motel, a whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go, ""Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn""
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friends

[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
A like that, y'all, a to the beat, y'all
A beat-beat, y'all, ya don't stop
A Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?

[Verse 10: Master Gee]
Well, like Johnny Carson on the late show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
A like the Bar-Kays singing ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds I throw down, a they're played the most
Just a like my man, a Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
A get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
A to the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive girl, a get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Bar-Kays on the mic
Like getting right down for you tonight
Like moving your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like coming alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two, I was doing the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Giving all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five, I didn't take no jive
'Cause with the Master Gee, it's all the way live
At the age of six, I was a picking up sticks
Rapping to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rocking in heaven
Don't ya know I went off?
I gotta run on down to the beat, you see
Getting right on down, making all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat, the beat
To the double beat-beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight I was a really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine I was a right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
We're going on and on, and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A saying on and on, and on, on and on
Like a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn
A going on and on, and don't ya dare stop
A rock-rock, y'all, a gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic
And I am the definite freak's delight
I'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite freak's delight
They call me the Master Gee, you see
The brother who rocks so viciously

What kind of man are you to lead a double life?
You spend your nights with me
Then go home to your wife
I won't be caught up in a three-way love affair
Your empty promises are scattererd in the air

So many times you told me
I was the one
You were the guy, I built my hopes upon
'Till my friend talked about her marriage last year
When I saw the picture, everything was clear

But all your alibis aren't even worth a dime
Without you in my life
I'll still get along
Oh it's tough baby, I'm gonna be strong
I don't wanna see you after today

[Part 1]
Im Schlaf hör' ich SOS-Band, drück' auf Recording
Early in the morning weckt mich Gap Band, was mich sofort
In Form bringt, ich empor spring' wie ein Dancefloor-King
Forthin beim Performing mit Funk versorgt bin
Full Force bringt mir daraufhin mein Frühstück
In's Ohr singt mir Aretha Franklin, das bringt früh Glück
Shalamar erinnern mich an die Nacht dann rasch
Ich war der Midnight Star, der mit dem Midas Touch
Ich hab' in's Mic gequatscht, es wurde gleich geklatscht
Mein Trouble Funk hat rasch jeden Quatsch weggebatscht
Es war 'n cooler Jam wie bei Kool and the Gang
Jede Crew, jeder Fan schrie Toni L. wie Hooligans
Ich hab' mich als Boss durch jede Box geboxt
Die Ladies kreischten, als sänge Lutzer Vandross
Diana Ross genoß, wie es in meinem lyrischen Schloß floß
Anschließend gaben mir die Four Tops Props
Diese Nacht war Hammer, heiß wie Donna Summer
Die Breaker tanzten mit James Brown auf Funky Drummer
Word up, selbst für Carneo war es nach meiner Show klar
Es gibt nur einen Toni L., der Funkjoker!

Hey DJ's, bitte spielt die Band Maze
Isaac Hayes, Rick James und Bar Kays!
Dann ist alles okay, alle rufen und schreien ""Let's groove tonight""
Und sehen mich mit den Moves von the Time
Wie Crusaders wollen wir funky Lieder kosten
Die von Ohio Players und Johnny Guitar Watson
Dazu muß Champaign als Luxus Zuschuß
Für heißen Blutfluß sorgen Chaka Khan und Rufus
Es ist open-doors, die Party powert auf allen Floors
Im Tower of Power könnt Ihr mit den Commodores
Alle zur funky Situation klatschen
Mit Temptation Delegation und Brass Construction
Andere machen Atlips, sind im Element wie die Dramatics
Es geht ab wie bei Parliament und Funkadelics
Oh ja, so war sogar Al Jarreau da

Leute springen happy und klitschnaß, wie bei den Pointer Sisters
Ich mache alle wie Barry White und seine Hits blass
Wenn ich das Mic wie Gladys Night and the Pips fass'
Bin oldschool wie die Drifters, weil ich Finger nie vom Stift lass'
So ist das Schicksal eines Dichters!
Komme Fatback wie ein Ebony Webb Track
Es macht Zapp auf jedem Headset, in dem mein Rap steckt
Mein funky Flow schau', mein funky Know How
Hab' ich aus Stevie Wonders Hometown Motown
Hört mit Leidenschaft, bin im Gehör und feier' ab
Eine Eigenschaft, die ich von Earth, Wind and Fire hab'
Bin unterwegs, weit wie Lakeside, mein Fame steigt
Von Stagetime zu Stagetime, kein Fake bleibt

She ace every test and she demand respect
She's got the kinda body that was built for sex
An intellect to match and then smarter than that
She's one of a kind and when she dance she grinds
She don't wear much make up but she makes up her mind
The decisive type she'll have you in a flash
Do you like a car crash and put you out with the trash
And when she's comes well she's loud in the ears
A thousand tears because she's older than time
A big behind and no career in mind

Yo, you don't wanna get mixed up with a guy like me, I'm a loner, a rebel
I still remember when my owner assembled me from like thousands of pieces of rotten cadavers
Now I'm lost in the caverns, gettin' wicked like David Seville of the chipmunks

[CHET:]
And all I want are my two front teeth to enjoy this meal in the back of my trunk

[MC DEVLIN:]
And I swing and I swang and I swung and I hope you brought the young
'Cause I'm here to mate and by mate I mean eat your children while they're fast asleep

[CHET:]
Loosen up my belt to ingest the dead
Chemically unstable inside my head
Sold my marbles to a man with a hook
He was trading me life for his hand that I took

[MC DEVLIN:]
Check the cortecca y'all cyborg girls I'm an analog man in a digital world
Layin down thoughts on the 4-track, tryin' to analyze life with a thorn in my thorax
Picnicking in the rain on electric blankets still plugged into the wall
I ain't a rebel with a cause, I'm a rebel on the scene with adamantium claws

[CHET:]
Kryptonite kills the flow of the rudeboy game but I'm still ruder than Lex
'Cause I wanna cop a feel with April O'Neil, find the secret of the ooze just to get that sex
And I heard one day when you go down low you gotta rub the beam to hear the Star Wars theme
A wookie told me ""uh-oh"", that place is a ""no-no""
Got to homeplate with C-3-P-O
Caught in a mix up (mix up) tryin to fix up your fallopian straw with my Mechanical Claw
My German chorizo lubed up in Crisco

Never bit the bait, but the bait bit me
'cause I got mad hits and these young girls won't let me be

[CHET:]
It was only a crime under 17

[MC DEVLIN:]
I was on the scene like a sex machine
Then every single thing below my waist turned green
So I hit up the doc for some topical lube
Then I used the tube to get rude in the room
On a Tuesday night in the TV light
I was feelin' alright (alright)
As an Indian woman with a jewel in her nose
Entered my room in the Catwoman clothes
[CHET:]
Took a personal day, she caressed me down
To my toes, then up to my crown
I'm alone no more but I'm still a loner
Still rebel at heart put my bat mask on
Yo Ma, can I iron my cape later on?

[MC DEVLIN:]
Rock on till the break of dawn
Fall asleep and wake up in the neighbor's lawn

[CHET:]
Hey, yo, don't get me wrong, no ounce of guilt I play women like Wilt
And when they tell me that's nothing but net
My heads up high, 'cause it's all I could get

[MC DEVLIN:]
Soylent green is a delicacy
In a rich hood, where the eatin' is good
I did it like this and I did it like that
And I did it with the Louisville wood and the whiffle ball bat and the soft ball metal
I'm a boiling kettle on a hot coal stove
I found myself but I lost my soul
Still it's all chill cause I'm just so goddamn ill

Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous
Ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight, incite a war

Into the fire, transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back? In the line of fire, holding back
What? My peoples; if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot, and blow spots
You wanna think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover, kid, what? Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team and your ""six can't rhyme"" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted

A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthesias

Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream

Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like I'm fucking ducking five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for the acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn'
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

And her ass is big round and wide
Jacked up, make a nigga down to ride
Smoking indo, playing that Super Nintendo
Hear a rat-a-Tat-Tat on my window
Gave her ass that pelvic thrust
Don't trust the rubber 'cause its bound to bust

Ain't no and, ifs, or maybes

[Verse 1: Posdnuos]
For my mornin' rise
I hop straight out of my bed to clear my head and my mornin' eyes
I was swollen in size
So I'm pulled back to the bed to my girl who's bony thighs
And it's no surprise
We spend another hour curled up intertwined like curly fries
Yet it's hard to stay, too much to do, too much to brew in my pot
The stew that I got I want to share with all
Yet I find many things that got me on stall, keep me on slow
Someone upfront, you better give chase
So I pick up the pace to pick up the dough
'Cause sometimes the bread comes in bits and crumbs
I spend half the day throwing fits in thumbs
On the keys of the BlackBerry trying to get a handle on my biz
Callouses from holding on so tight
And the days grow long as something goes wrong that felt so right
My neck's in pain from holding the heavy head up
Lay the chin up, trying to stay the pin-up
On the walls of your mind
Top 5, we drop live on every stage touched
As well as the life pumping your chest clutch
Let me know you a fan of the brand
So I keep with the plan
I keep moving

Summer's in the rear, now we crafting toons
Imagine how many stacks to relax the goons
Who be after that harvest that done lapsed in June
And perhaps if we all collapsed in saloons
Popping corks front page in the last tribune
And the headline read ""He'd been acting the coon""
But I was asleep catching Z's in mittens
The season is written in cookbooks
I put a feast on a tab and let the youngs dogs indulge
Pardon the way we expand is the garden of bulge
It's the growth of self
See the price ain't changed on that [?]
If crack don't get em, the rock's soon got em
As fast as [?] could set shop in Harlem
I'm setting up the camp and we gon champion change
We gon see if [?] advances the stage or if the curtain's on em
We're more certain when everybody's naked
Silk ties may make em feel better
But I get my connects via the fabric of respect
If that don't get them, we gon gather ever Tec
Every handgun, missile, wood hand and pistol
Embark on their doorsteps [?]
To mile them [?] God bless the child
And Lord tell my pops he made a man out of death
I got a ticket up to see him when I'm done here
It ain't even one year gone with more work to do

Every morning I took the train to High Street Station
Doing homework on the train, what a fucked up situation
On the way back up, hearing battle tapes
Through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes

As I develop the awakening mind
I praise the Buddhas as they shine
I bow before you as I travel my path
To join your ranks, I make my full-time task
For the sake of all beings I seek
The enlightened mind that I know I'll reap
Respect to Shantideva and all the others
Who brought down the Dharma for the sisters and brothers
I give thanks for this world as a place to learn
And for this human body that I know I've earned
And my deepest thanks to all sentient beings
For without them, there would be no place to learn what I'm seeing
There's nothing here that's not been said before
But I put it down now so that I'll be sure
To solidify my own views
And I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too

If others disrespect me or give me flak
I'll stop and think before I react
Knowing that they're going through insecure stages
I'll take the opportunity to exercise patience
I'll see it as a chance to help the other person
Nip it in the bud before it can worsen
A chance for me to be strong and sure
As I think on the Buddhas who have come before
As I praise and respect the good they've done
Knowing love can conquer hate in every situation
We need other people in order to create
The circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate
Situations that bring up our deepest fears
So we can work to release them until they're cleared
Therefore it only makes sense
To thank our enemies despite their intent

A strength from within to go the length
Seeing others are as important as myself

With the interconnectedness that we share as one
Every action that we take affects everyone
So in deciding for what a situation calls
There is a path for the good for all
I try to make my every action for that highest good
With the altruistic wish to achieve Buddhahood
So I pledge here before everyone who's listening
To try to make my every action for the good of all beings
For the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond
I vow to do my best, to do no harm
And in times of doubt, I can think on the Dharma
And the Enlightened Ones who've graduated Samsara6Embed",hiphop

Smoke the holy chalice, got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians
Like Jerry Lee Swaggart or Jerry Lee Falwell
You love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And we love the hot butter (Say what?) The popcorn
Sippin' on wine and mackin'
Rockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin', yeah
Ride the wave of fate, it don't ride me, Homes
(Being very proud of bein' emcees)
And then the man upstairs, well, I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts, I'd be a millionaire
Amps and crossovers under my rear hood
Because the bass is bumping from the back of my Fleetwood
They tell us what to do? Hell no!
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego!

My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on
We're comin' with the limericks, and we're comin' strong
And the rhythm's on time, to every word and rhyme
When it comes to keep it real, I keep it really wrong

At the risk of sounding crass, I would like to mention
That I am well aware of your wack intentions
To usurp my prose, you so-and-so
It's my primary bone of contention

I tell you, everybody, I've had it
With all these people with static
I'll go insane if it don't rain
Sucker MCs are problematic

I love it when you hit those switches
A curve ball's what my pitch is
So here we—here we come
Like dum-ditty-dum
I keep all five boroughs in stitches

Listen everybody lets show improve
Don't let me begin about heroin
Living six feet deep just ain't the move

We're giving you soul power
I like it sweet and sour

Of all these people you say you hate
Just give it one time for your mind
And let's try to negotiate

But that won't change your situation

Until your back's up against the wall
You never know yourself that much at all
So you've got to share your love with a friend
That's all that you've got left in the end
Living in this city of pure confusion
People misled by their own illusion
All this action, no satisfaction
We're all linked together like a chain reaction

And I got more hits than Sadaharu Oh
Tom Thumb, Tom Cushman, or Tom Foolery
Date women on TV with the help of Chuck Woolery
Words flowin' out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out lookin' for a female companion
I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on the bib
Wheelin' and dealin', I make a little bit of a stealin'
I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peelin'
Your body's on time and your mind is appealin'
Starin' at the cracks up there up on the ceilin'
Such and such will be the bass that I'm throwin'

I dropped my drawers and said, ""Welcome back Kotter""
We was cuttin' up the rug, she started cuttin' up the carpet
In my apartment, I begged her please stop it
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothin' but a crab
Educated: no, stupid: yep
And when I say stupid, I mean stupid fresh
I'm not James At 15 or Chachi in charge
I'm Adam, and I'm adamant about livin' large
With the white Sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville
I met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie, but I kicked her in the booty
Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listenin' to my records', a number one sound

Break up with your girl, it ended in tears

I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'
The phone booth on the corner is damp, and it's stinkin'
She said come on over, it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window 'cause you know I got dissed
Your old lady left you, and you went insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 Train
Well, take my advice at any price
A gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man
Suckin' down pints 'til I didn't know
Woke up in the morning with the Won Ton Ho
'Cause I announce, I like girls that bounce

And beatnik chicks, just wearing their smocks
Walkin' high and mighty like she's number one
She thinks she's the passionate one

And this one's about the KO's, the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up (Wait a minute)

[Verse 2: Pos]
Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle

Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I'll initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless

I won't lie, I love B-U-D-D-Y (why)
'Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny I seem
(Very serious) like a Peek Frean
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lift
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff
[Verse 7: Afrika]
Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree, I hope that you're not mad at me
'Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

[Verse 8: Dove]
On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the (Q-Tip: Q to her Tip)

Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

[Verse 9: Mike G]
Behind my bush, my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Or let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll
(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

[Verse 10: Q-TIP]
Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul, here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun, lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy, I will boast
That we're like Ethel Mertz and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mine and I can be your buddy

[Verse 11: Dove]
The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' lets Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed
(Word)

[Verse 12: Afrika]
Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

[Verse 13: Mike G]
And I watched and then I checked my Swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Never mistake me for a fake MC
You got the wrong identity, nigga I'm CT fool
Get murdered in a second in the first degree

A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular, my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like I'm fucking ducking five-year probation
[Verse 6: GZA]
War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for the acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn'
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

[Verse 7: Masta Killa]
The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none
[Verse 8: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, fuck that!
Look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a navy green salamander fiend
Bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali, came in threes
We like the Genovese, sazon season these degrees
It's Earth, 93 million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
A-yo, that's amazing
Gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor, word tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat, God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Yo, I wrote this in Haiti overlookin' Cuba
I asked her what's her name, she said, ""Guantanamera""
Remind me of an old Latin song my uncle used to play
On his old forty-five when he used to be alive
She went from a young girl to a grown woman
Like a virgin, so she sex with no average man
Peep the figure, move like a caterpillar
Fly like a butterfly, let your soul feel her glide
Pac-Woman, better yet Space Invader
If your name was Chun-Li, we'd be playin' Street Fighter
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Yo, she was a rose in Spanish Harlem, mamacita, beg your pardon
Make stakes at a faster rate than she fornicates (In Spanish Harlem)
Pure traits of genius, goddess of Black Venus
Crab niggas angry 'cause they can't get between us
To no selección, smooth complexion
The lexicon of Lexington, parents came from Cuba
Part Mexican, pure sweet, Dons fell to her feet
She like Movado and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggas down from the Grounds to Apollo
And then some, she took her act, sent it to dim sum
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street Secret Service
This gentle flower, fertility was her power
Sweet persona, Venus flytrap prima-donna
Que será, que será she turned dinero to dinera

Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, The Abstract
And me, the Five Footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
Um... um... a tidbit, um... a smidgen
I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
Heh, okay, you on point, Phife? All the time, Tip

Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack, that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that Buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt, the Jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk

Okay, if knowledge is the key, then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed, I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent Black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Umm
Well, it's kinda simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids, watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Well, off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum
And proper, what you say, Hammer? Proper

But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little somethin' on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat

Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood (What?)
But hun, you got the goods like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik, the Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week?
She simply said, ""No,"" labeled me a ho
I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hun, I don't get down like that
[Verse 5: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep' in my Jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl, I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture

Stacy Beadle, PJ, and my man LG

Brother, brother, brother, Lucien, you're like no other
Listen very close 'cause I don't like to boast
Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail
We ain't on sale, your rumor starts to wail
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail?
Deport you back to France on a ship with a sail
Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails
(Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?)
From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris
Came to America to find liberty
Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery
But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me
Oh, luck-luck will drive your butt batty
Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy
In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could
But listen, brother man, I really think you can
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back

I won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try
You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?
Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?
Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad
In fact, it would be nice if we understood him, right?

Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues

This pine box ain't strong enough to contain the Afro locks
Critical bell rings, snapped out the dream

Pointin' at me? I got no strap G
What now? Gotta duck, they're gonna gat me

But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin', I've had it up to here
My days of payin' dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (Yeah!)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meanin' from the get-go
Sit back, relax, and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know

Inside, outside, come around

So may I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates
Contact!
Can I get a hit? (Hit!) Boom bip
With a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip
East coast stompin', rippin', and rompin'
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down for the flex
Next it's the textbook, old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me, yo, what's the scenario?

[Verse 3: Dinco D | all]
(True, blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the s'mores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape, crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah, an -eader! Simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see you later
Later (Later!) Later, alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the urge to inflate her
So, yo, the D, what, the O
Incorporated I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped, flat back, first this, foul, fight, fight, fight, laugh
Yo, how'd that sound? (Oooh!)
[Verse 4: Q-Tip | Busta Rhymes | all]
It's a Leader-Quest mission and we got the goods here (Here!)
Never on the left, 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime, so I ain't no criminal!
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo, Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did
I heard you rushed and rushed and attacked
Then they rebuked and you had to smack
Causin' rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear (You know I did it)
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on a played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario:

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes | all]
Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!
Not braggin', tryna read my mind, just imagine
Vocabulary's necessary when diggin' into my library
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Eatin' Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh, uh
Ugh, ugh, ugh! All over the track, man
Ugh, pardon me, ugh! As I come back!
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Rawr! Rawr! Like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers, 'cause your pants are saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smellin' rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kickin'
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Uh!), the rhymes are on time (Time!)
Rippin' up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
[Chorus: All | Busta Rhymes]

Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half-step cause I'm not a half-stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two-inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you don't it's just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
""Oh yo he's acting stank,"" really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged
[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling an MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out

Standing on the stage dripping, pouring with sweat
To people in the crowd I give what they get
Papers make paid, babies make laid
I don't really worry nor do I fret
Waiting for the gimme and boy I got some
Sweet like a peach and tart like a plum
I thought what I think, I rock a bead link
Legally I sip when I turn twenty-one
A letter to the homeboy that freaked the head dome
The army wants me to drop my microphone
Gotta be brief, no orders from a chief
Hot butter on what, say what, the popcorn
On the tour bus we hit the truck stop
A dollar for some chips, a quarter for some pop
We laugh and giggle some, Phife gets the honeybuns
Ali Shaheed Muhammad keeps talking that shop
The brothers cruise on as we quest for the check
Calling up Famous to see if it's there yet
Not a bourgeoise, hate the seminar
Ignorant flip, hey miss you must jet

Used to be a bottle now a 40 and a girl
Standing on the corner cold chilling, talking shit
Wake up in the morning fix a plate of hominy grits
Change my diaper, clean my pacifier
Smoke to get higher if I would like to jump
Muhammad drum machining, dust it off clean and
Make a funky beat to keep the street steaming
Look from the heart and cold living lum
Good from the start like a newborn nun
Eat to get fatter, but that don't matter
Born out in Brooklyn and that's where I'm from
May 22nd out on Ocean Ave
From around the way so I be knowing the half
Peace to Sweet Daddy and on to Mike G
The harder they come is as hard as we be

If the papes come yo yo I won't riff
I'll just sit down and get me a spliff
With mines I was born, a child of the corn
Molecules of the land they uplift
Levels is straight, in fact they're rectified
Adrenaline now is crazy multiplied
Four and four is eight, if fat shit makes the plate
I make sure the Tribe is in
With the quickness you bear the witness
Flexing and pumping with the fitness
Moving it - uh, doing it - uh
Those who oppose must hit the s-list
Doing it, doing it with the whole frame
Look what's in the mind and not in the brain
On this you can quote, we on a diffy note
Quest for the future, 'stead of the fame

Forgot the name, oh, equivalent to Jimmy

Slamming with a slammy you front, on the case

My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, and paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he can get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
I pulled over to ask where we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
El segundo, he said, my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto
Need a civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south there's a fast food station
Thanks, señor, as I started the motor
Ali said ""Damn, Tip, what did you drive so far for?""

I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said: pay for lunch, so I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed
""Yo Tip man, you got what you need?""
I checked for keys and started to step
And what do you know, my wallet I forget

Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder

Breaking on out, we was northeast bound
Jetting on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, ""all right, Tip, see you tomorrow
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torped' to the shack
Of Shaheed, we gotta go back
When he said ""Why?,"" I said ""We gotta go

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha!)

Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes

Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room

And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it

Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""

Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

So get the morgue truck and embalm the goner

They treat you like an ace that can't beat a trey
A no-use number with no-use people
If your life is on the line then you're dead today
Latecomers with the late coming stretcher
That's a body bag in disguise y'all, I'll betcha
I call 'em body snatchers cause they come to fetch ya
With an autopsy ambulance just to dissect ya
They are the kings cause they swing amputation
Lose you arms or legs to their miscalculation

And Black and White is still too bad
That's why everytime I turn around
All the people in my neighborhood
Look and get mad and sing

Peace be upon us

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
When I'm talkin' rhyme time
It's blow your mind time some say
It's nothing worse than a verse
To hear some nigga curse
They call me rude some dudes fiery attitude
Claimin' I boast and smoke
And sometimes sing the blues
I twang metal and settle
Try to never back pedal
From the power some got
To get a nigga shot
The null and void I avoid
I test the paranoid
Never had to be bad
My mama raised me mad
So what I got is hot
I love my life a lot
I'm never sad just glad
That's why I thank my dad
Naw, I ain't with this
I ain't with it
I ain't with it

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
Instead of peace the police
Just wanna wreck and flex
On the kid
What I did was try to be the best
So they fingered the trigger
Figured I was a bigger nigga
And they started to search me
So I headed West
Went to Cali a rally
Was for a brother's death
It was the fuzz who shot him
And not the bloods or cuzz
I wondered why it was like
So I just held my mic
But in my mind I was blind
So I just tried to find
A reason we was
Just the way that we was
So I just stayed in the crib
Until I got a buzz...

[Outro: Flavor Flav & Big Daddy Kane]
What man, what? What is it, man?
It's Kane, G
Yeah, boy! What's up, G?
Yo man, me and Ice Cube got this movie in effect you with it?

Burn Hollywood burn I smell a riot
Goin' on -- first they're guilty, now they're gone
Yeah I'll check out a movie
But it'll take a Black one to move me
Get me the hell away from this T.V
All this news and views are beneath me
So all I hear about is shots ringing out
About gangs putting each other's head out
So I rather kick some slang out
All right fellas let's go hang out
Hollywood or would they not
Make us all look bad like I know they had
But some things I'll never forget, yeah
So step and fetch this shit
For all the years we looked like clowns
The joke is over -- smell the smoke from all around
Burn Hollywood burn

[Ice Cube]
Ice Cube is down with the P.E
Now every single bitch wanna see me
Big Daddy is smooth, word to mother
Let's check out a flick that exploits the color
Roaming through Hollywood late at night
Red and blue lights what a common sight
Pulled to the curb, getting played like a sucker
Don't fight the power *gunshot* the motherfucker

As I walk the streets of Hollywood Boulevard
Thinking how hard it was to those that starred
In the movies portraying the roles
Of butlers and maids, slaves and hoes
Many intelligent Black men seemed
To look uncivilized when on the screen
Like, I guess I figure you to play some jigaboo
On the plantation, what else can a nigga do
And Black women in this profession
As for playing a lawyer, out of the question
For what they play Aunt Jemima is the perfect term
Even if now she got a perm
So let's make our own movies like Spike Lee
Cause the roles being offered don't strike me
As nothing that the black man could use to earn
Burn Hollywood burn

""Now we're considering you for a part in our new production. How do you feel about playing a controversial negro?""
""Yeah, I'm wid it. You mean somebody like Huey P. Newton or H. Rap Brown, right?""
""Well, it's a servant character that chuckles a little bit, and sings.""
""Yo, man, what?? That's bullshit.""

""Hey Cube, Kane, Flav, listen. I hope you ain't wastin' my time. You know how I feel about givin' these movies my money, know what I'm sayin'?  I work hard for it""
""Yo, man, it's gonna be dope, man.""

Once again, this is it
Turn it up, here we go
But this time the rhyme's
Gonna ask who did the crime
Then let's get down to the nitty-gritty
I wanna know who
Picked Wilson's pocket
After he rocked it
Fact, he shocked it
Same kinda thing they threw at James (Brown)
And what they did to Redd was a shame
The bigger the Blacks get
The bigger the feds want
A piece of that ... booty
Intentional Rape System, like we ain't
Paid enough in this bitch, that's why I dissed them
I learned we earned, got no concern
Instead we burned, where the hell is our return?
Plain and simp, the system's a pimp
But I refuse to be a ho who stole the soul

[Verse 2]
Ain't, no, different than in South Africa
Over here they'll go after ya to steal your soul
Like over there they stole our gold
Yo, they say the Black don't know how to act (Who, me?)
Cause we're waitin' for the big payback
But we know it'll never come
That's why I say come and get some
Why when the Black moves in, Jack moves out
Come to stay Jack moves away
Ain't we all people?
How the hell can a color be no good to a neighborhood
Help, straighten me out
Cause my tribe gets a funny vibe
Sayin' I'm wrong for singin' a song
Without solutions
All the dancers answer questions
Try to be the best and...
Let everybody know before I blow
Cuz I wanna know what sucka stole the soul

We choose to use their ways
And holidays notice some of them are heller days
Invented by those that never repented
For the sins within that killed my kin
But that's all right
I try do what a brother does
But I'll never know if you're my cuz
That's why I try my best to unite
Damn the rest if they don't like it
Banned from many arenas
Word from the motherland
Has anybody seen her
Jack was nimble, Jack was quick
Got a question for Jack ask him
40 acres and a mule Jack
Where is it why'd you try to fool the Black
It wasn't you, but you pledge allegiance
To the red, white, and blue

Where is Public Enemy? What's the big deal?
What's your latest hit, brother?
(Fear of a Black Planet)

[Verse 1]
Man, don't you worry 'bout a thing
'Bout your daughter, nope she's not my type
(But suppose she said she loved me?)
Are you afraid of the mix of Black and White?
Livin' in a land where the law say
Mixing of race makes the blood impure
She's a woman I'm a man
Look at your face, I see ya can't stand it

[Interlude: Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Man you need to calm down, don't get mad
I don't need your sista
But suppose she said she loved me?
Would you still love her or would you dismiss her?
What is pure? Who is pure?
Is it European? I ain't sure
If the whole world was to come through peace and love
Then what would we be made of?

Excuse us for the news
You might not be amused
But did you know White comes from Black
No need to be confused
Excuse us for the news
I question those accused
Why is this fear of Black from White

[Verse 3]
Man, I don't want your wife
Stop screamin', it's not the end of your life
(But suppose she said she loved me?)
What's wrong with some color in your family tree?
I don't know, hey, I'm just a rhyme sayer
Skins protected 'gainst the ozone layers
Breakdown, 2001
Might be best to be Black or just Brown, countdown

[Interlude: Chuck D + instrumental]

[Verse 4]
I've been wonderin' why people livin' in fear of my shade
(Or my high-top fade)
I'm not the one that's runnin', but they got me on the run
Treat me like I had a gun
All I got is genes and chromosomes
Consider me Black to the bone
All I want is peace and love on this planet
Ain't how that God planned it?

Huh, (Hey!)

[Interlude]
""The true worth of a race must be measured by the character of its woman...""

[Verse 1]
Just a matter of race
'Cause a black male's in their face
Step back for the new jack swing
On the platter, scatter, huh
(We got our own thing)
Yes, just jam, let the rhythm run (Boy!)
Day to day, America eats its young
And defeats our women
There is a gap so wide, we all can swim in
Drown in (Uh, get down!) and get it
Got it goin' on with it
Sister (hey) soul sister, we goin' be all right
It takes a man to take a stand
Understand it takes a woman to make a stronger man
(As we both get strong)
They'll call me a crazy Asiatic while I'm singin' a song
(Oh, oh!) Oh my God, oh my lord, I can't hold back
So I get exact on a track
It's an eye for eye, tooth for tooth
Forget about me, just set my sister free (Sisters!)
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
My sister's not my enemy
'Cause we'll be stronger together to make them all say

(I don't know what this world's coming to!)
They don't know what we got goin' is (sound)
(See you!) To turn it all around
To my sisters I communicate with the bass and tone
Thru speakers and the microphone
'Cause I'm tired of America dissin' my sisters
(For example, like they dissed Tawana)
And they try to say that she's a liar
My people don't believe it, but even now they're getting higher
Off the feeling, inspiration
We must know that in this nation
Every single generation
(They teach us how to diss our sisters)
Strange as you say, I say ""revolution""
Need for change brings a revolution
The great book, look see solution
God chooses what and who for the bruisin'
There's been no justice for none of my sisters
Just us been the one that's been missin' her
Now we got to protect
To get together and damn! (This generation)

[Pre-Hook]
I said so to what it is
Where it is, she needs a lil' respect (There it is)
I would say she needs a lotta
Brother from a mother like me has gotta
Give it up (Give it now)
And pass it all around to my soul sister
[Verse 3]
They disrespected mama and treated her like dirt
America took her, reshaped her, raped her
No, it never made the paper
Beat us, mated us
Made us attack our woman in black
So I said ""sophisticated B"" (Don't be one!)
Not to heed the warning crack of dawn
Or is it the dawn of crack? (Uh oh)
Stop the talk they say, but we talk and say whats right or wrong
Some say we wasting time singing a song
But why is it that we're many different shades
Black woman's privacy invaded years and years
You cannot count my mama's tears
It's not the past, the future's what she fears
Strong, we be strong, the next generation
It's what, not who, we're facin'
The fingers pointed to us in our direction
The blind state of mind needs correction
Word to the mother, we tighten connection
To be a man, you need no election
This generation generates a new attitude (Yeah!)
Sister to you we should not be rude
So we come together
And make 'em all say 'damn'! (This generation!)Embed",hiphop

Just clap your hands to the beat
Just clap your hands to the beat, to the beat

[Verse 1]
So here we go y'all
Little by little you know
We got the power
And the knowledge to move 'em
And still rock
A super song for the cause so
Feel the load on your brain for the episode (Yeah)
And we just begun, it's number one y'all
Brother Black, the B is back
So check this out

And 'ya don't, I won't, if 'ya still, I will
Take three jams and hold 'em, this what I told 'em
Rock the other side, the sucker lied
Said he would shock but never tried, and so I—I
Took 'em away, I never stayed y'all
I called Flavor Flav, another record to get played, played
He made a jam to get you slammed
Back to back in the place where the suckers are basin', basin'
Whatever it takes to make it hardcore—core
We gonna roll it raw
That's what you buy it for, c'mon
You roll in your ride, the DJ decides
To play it on the radio—dio, the A side
He gives it a try but never really gives it a try
And the people request the best on the B side
You might also like[Verse 3]
Food for the brain, beats for the feet
People on the dance floor never claimin' a receipt
Had a good time rockin' rollin' on the go rhyme
The rhythm supplied by the superior B side
They had to twist and turn and shout
Turn the jam out, getcha ready now, c'mon
The situation put you in
To where you're sweatin' in
Hysterical B side, c'mon inside
I quest the best to give a test
And never given a rest
Your guess is good as my guess
And while I'm guessin' your guessin', yo listen this is
A DJ to play to give a lesson
And his (Uh-oh) name (Look out) is (Yeah) Terminator X

[Verse 4]
And the suckers on the right get cynical
'Cause the record's to the left and political
And you search the stores
Attack the racks with your claws
For the rebels without a pause
'Cause the B side
Wins again, again, again
Yo Black, some of you are all in
To make sure the crowd
Get loud wit' it on the dance floor
'Cause the B is pure sure
I never knew the crowd was this hype
But you thought we was that type
To start a riot, we ain't quiet
In a thunderstorm with a song
Why would we dare you to come along
Pump up the music, pump the sound
Once again we gonna do it like this now
And while I'm throwin', you're goin'
And you know it's time for man on a mission
To listen cause he's in the house
He's Terminator XEmbed",hiphop

Rhyme's designed to fill your mind, now that you've
Realized the pride's arrived, we got to
Pump the stuff to make ya tough, from the heart
It's a start, a work of art
To revolutionize, make a change, nothin's strange

We're not the same 'cause we don't know the game
What we need is awareness, we can't get
Careless! You say, ""What is this?""

Through deep valleys and forests
Crossing great rivers
In search of the knowledge of the gods
From far beyond place and time
I hear a whispering wind
It tells me to strive on
Through the horizon of my thoughts

I am the mindtraveller
My quest is man's destiny
Teach me secret holy spells
And the wisdom of the elderly

Gazing into my mind
Entering my soul
Is there not a secret to unfold

From the sunlight of my home
And I have seen it's the only way
Now my sun is dead and gone

The only way out is to go
Where no one's gone before

And I can't wait until tomorrow
Ride, there's a call from deep within
No, I won't return again

The ESU team is shackling Luke for arrest.

COP: All right, here's the plan. Triple-cuff him. Alpha team, you take point positions in the convoy. Bravo team will bring up the rear. Remember, we're clear to engage, so if he so much as looks at you funny, light him up.

COP: Copy that. You hear that, freak? I got something special for you.

LUKE: This isn't necessary.

COP: Yeah, it is.

Misty is looking on from her ambulance. She gets up and starts walking towards Luke.

PARAMEDIC: No. You need to let us finish. Ms. Knight...Ms. Knight!

MISTY: It's Detective Knight, and I'm fine. (to the ESU guy) I need a moment with Cage.

ESU GUY: Misty, we have special orders.

MISTY: Mario, come on. I was just held hostage. I just need a minute with him.

ESU GUY: All right. We'll be right here. We got your back.

COP: Clear!
MISTY (ostentatiously): You going down. It's about damn time. Cottonmouth, Officer Albini, what just popped off in there? ...Look, your friend is in the wind. They've got public enemy number one in handcuffs for the whole world to see so they're not looking for anybody else. Every officer in your detail has those modified Judas bullets. I wouldn't try anything if I were you...before I got to the precinct.
You're not that crazy, are you?

LUKE: Always.

MISTY: Take his ass to jail.

COP: Come on.

COP: All right, let's go. We're rolling.

They load Luke into the truck and drive away. The two cops in the front seat discuss him.

COP 1: Three sets of cuffs? Isn't that overkill?

COP 2: The camera's on. We need to look like we're in control.

COP 1: It's a shit detail. You'd think ESU would be in the back with those guns pointed at him.

COP 2: We've got the same guns and bullets they do.

COP 1: You know, my wife says it's the end of days, people like him popping up.

COP 2: They've been saying that since Eve bit the apple. Cage? He's evolution.

COP 1: Whatever he is, it's just scary. Makes me feel small. Insignificant.
COP 2: Insecure? You know what they say. Once you go black, you never go back. At least that's what your wife keeps telling me.

In the back of the van, Luke easily breaks his shackles.

COP 2: Just sit tight.

COP 1: God damn it. Homeless lady. Can't they move her out of the way?

COP 1 (To the woman, over megaphone): You are in the path of a police convoy. Clear the road immediately.

Luke breaks out of the van and runs.

The cops chase Luke through alleys. Luke comes to a dead end and slams into a side door. He slips through the building and ocmes out on the other side. He sees a police car drive past him and relaxes, but then hears the sound of a shotgun behind him.

COP 2: Young cops always wanna chase somebody. Me? I'd rather be where they're already going. They told us these Judas bullets can kill someone like you. You don't want to die? Don't run.

LUKE: I'd rather die than go back to prison.

COP 2: Live free or die? You wanna get all New Hampshire about this shit? Fine with me. Cop killers don't survive these streets.

COP 2: Some people are calling you a hero for what you did. Connie's, Pop's...

LUKE: I'm no hero. But I do need to take out the person responsible for all this.

COP 2: You don't recognize me, do you?

LUKE: I've seen you at Pop's before.

COP 2: Pop cut my hair for 12 years. He didn't think he was a hero, either. He was just trying to do some right after years of wrong....I hope I'm right about you. More people rooting for you than you think.

STRYKER: I understand you're a man of discretion and taste with numerous connections willing to pay full price for my wares. I can still collect from the shadows.

Zip comes in, wearing a pair of sunglasses.

ZIP: Bad news, Diamondback.

STRYKER: Take those off!

ZIP: I went to your crib. The files you had are gone.

Stryker walks over to Zip and grabs his throat, choking him and pushing him to the ground. He holds him there for a moment before he starts to laugh and lets him go.

STRYKER: I had you, didn't I? I couldn't resist. I like you, Zip. You've got ambition. It'll take you far as long as you stay in your place. The first of the 48 laws of power. Never outshine the master. That was the mistake Shades made. He questioned me. He doubted me. He tried to reach too far. He was on some Icarus shit. Do you know who that is?

ZIP:  Yeah, he had a verse with Kendrick.  Right?

TURK: No Icarus was the boy who flew too close to the sun with fake wings.

ZIP: Shades is no problem. He's still in custody.

STRYKER: Not for long.

ZIP: You gonna blow the joint up?

STRYKER: No, he's going to be bailed out.

MISTY: He's a black man being chased by the cops oh, with special bullets. Accused of killing a cop, and you're asking why he's running? Come on.

RIDLEY: Look at how relaxed Hernan ""Shades"" Alvarez is. He knows he's not going anywhere anytime soon, so he's resting up. He knows he's guilty. See this perp? Look how his foot is bouncing. Nervous. No wonder his street name is Sugar. I don't even have to say a word, and here come the waterworks. He's probably innocent or less guilty than whoever he's about to give up.

MISTY: That's a detectives' wives' tale. You can't prove guilt or innocence by that.

RIDLEY: Oh, but you can...because Luke gave you his word.

MISTY: Luke...

RIDLEY: Right now, his actions are speaking louder than his words.

MISTY: Luke Cage saved my life.

RIDLEY: I don't dispute that we should be bringing in Diamondback, but to get to the truth, we need to bring them both in.

MISTY: Okay, well, let me lead the charge. Make sure Luke is brought in safely.

RIDLEY: He threw away his chance when he jumped out that damn van. Now they will shoot him on sight with the mayor's blessing.

MISTY: You know what? At least let me take a crack at Shades. He's in deep with all the players. He doesn't scare me.

LUKE: Hey, it's me...Yeah, they'll be looking for me. I'll lay in the cut. I'll see you in a few.

Luke puts the phone away, looks to Method Man.

LUKE: You a double XL?

METHOD MAN: Way ahead of you, homie.

They trade hoodies. Luke takes a minute to destroy the robbers' gun.

LUKE: Call the cops.

BODEGA OWNER: I know a lot of people who would pay you for this kind of protection.

LUKE: They can keep their money.

METHOD MAN: Salute...You ever see anything like that before?

BODEGA OWNER: Harlem, baby. Harlem.

THE STATIONHOUSE
Misty is walking down the hall. Her phone rings.

MISTY: Hello?

CANDACE: Detective Knight?

MISTY: Candace?

CANDACE: Yeah.

MISTY: What number are you calling me from?

CANDACE: A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS. I need to see you.

MISTY: Come into the precinct.

CANDACE: No. No. You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.

MISTY: You didn't wanna talk to me before. What makes you trust me now?

CANDACE: Because Luke Cage does. He saved my life. And you saw right through me. You want the truth, right?

MISTY: Where are you?

CANDACE: Look, if you can't help...

MISTY: Candace.

CANDACE: Tell me a place, and I will be there.

INTERROGATION ROOM

RIDLEY: You should be at Rikers right now, but I held you because I think you have something to say.

SHADES: Lawyer.

RIDLEY: I know your record, Mr. Alvarez. Came up in Harlem, rolled around with Cottonmouth in the late '90s, spent some time at Spofford, Sing Sing, then you made it to the big time, went to Seagate.

SHADES: Lawyer.

RIDLEY: Cornell Stokes is dead, but you're still alive. And I've never seen an arraignment happen so quickly. Two million dollar bail and someone paid it in cash. Who's your new sponsor? Is it Willis Stryker?

SHADES: Law...yer.

RIDLEY: You were part of a hostage situation, Hernan. Even if your lawyer does get you out you won't be walking away from that. That's multiple kidnapping and weapons charges. How does 25 years to life sound to you? Minimum.

SHADES: Are you serious?

RIDLEY: Yep.

SHADES: Okay. Okay. I I was in the club. I saw what happened. I know who did it.

RIDLEY: Okay. We can protect you, but I need a name to verify. Who was it? Was it Stryker?

SHADES: He goes by...lawyer. You need me to spell it?

Shades laughs Ridley out the door.
THE WATERSIDE

CANDACE: You call this safe?

MISTY: We're hiding in plain sight. I've got you...For now. Lie to me again, Candace, I walk away from here, and you are on your own.

CANDACE: It's not bullshit.

MISTY: We'll see. How did you even get out of Harlem's Paradise without being stopped?

CANDACE: They were so busy trying to arrest Luke, I just walked away.

MISTY: So what is it? What do you need to tell me that's so important?

CANDACE: I was at the club the night Cottonmouth died.

MISTY: I already know that.

CANDACE: I mean right after.

Misty deliberately takes out her phone and holds it up so Candace can see her touch the ""record"" button.

CANDACE: Mariah killed him.

Misty pictures herself in Harlem's Paradise as Shades and Mariah cover up the crime.

SHADES (flashback):The trash bag is for the clothes you're wearing now. Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too. Someone from Spurlock's will incinerate them....The secret to any good lie is it has to run parallel to the truth....

MISTY: How do you know this?

CANDACE:  I heard them talking about it.

SHADES (flashback): ...do what I say...

CANDACE: The guy who always wears sunglasses, he was there. It was his idea to say Luke Cage killed Cottonmouth. I was so scared. I snuck out of there, back to the lockers.
And, um, I was trying to calm myself down. When I went upstairs, the guy with the glasses offered me $50,000 to tell a story. So I told one.

MISTY: Why are you coming clean now?

CANDACE: 'Cause I can't live with this. Especially after Luke saving my life. If you can guarantee my safety, I will testify about everything I just told you.

Misty stops recording and puts her phone away.

Mariah scares me more than Cottonmouth. I asked her if she thought Luke did it, mostly to see if I could trust her. To see if she would tell me the truth. She looked me right in my eye and said ""You never know what anyone is capable of."" It was the way she said it. She...she would kill me if she knew I was speaking to you, I truly believe that. Thank you for helping me.

MISTY: I'm gonna nail Mariah Dillard's ass to the wall. Who else knows that you're here?

CANDACE: Just my friend Leslie.

MISTY: Don't call anyone else, not even Leslie. As a matter of fact, give me your phone. Come on.

CANDACE: Okay.

Misty hands her a new burner.

MISTY: Now, I picked this up on the way, just in case. It's already got my number programed in there, so if I call or text, you know it's me.

CANDACE: Is your arm okay?

MISTY:  My trigger finger is just fine.
Come on, let's go.

CANDACE: Where?

MISTY: Soledad's. Her daughter Claire is the one who treated your ankle at Harlem's Paradise. She'll be there, too. I'm gonna take you there myself.

Nearby, Alex watches them from a car.
SWAY'S STUDIO

METHOD MAN: No lie. Bullets was flying everywhere and shit.

HEATHER B:You trying to tell me that those are bullet holes? Man, Meth, I love you, but get out of here. I don't believe that.

METHOD MAN: HB, I thought the same thing until shorty pulled the biscuit and let two off on Cage and they bounced off. Bullets ricochetin' and shit. Look, I'm telling y'all the truth. I see y'all over there, y'all don't believe it.
Trust me, it's the truth. And after he smacked fire out these dudes, he left the hoodie, told me and Gomez to call the police...You know I ain't calling no po-po...Then he bounced.

SWAY: Say word.

METHOD MAN: Word, Sway. I'm telling you. He even balled the dude's gun up like some old homework.

HEATHER B: But my thing is, though, if he innocent, so what he running for?

METHOD MAN: Bulletproof always gonna come second to being black. HB, you should know that. You from Jers. Jers!

SWAY: Wow! Sound like he stunted on you right there.

HEATHER B: He did stunt. It was a stunt. It was a stunt. Why you gotta stunt on me?

METHOD MAN: No, I mean, seriously. Seriously, though, what I'm just saying, like, if that was me, and I was on the run...Why even get involved? But he did. And those dudes was nervous, so anything could've happened. As far as I'm concerned, Luke Cage saved my life, man.

SWAY: That's what's up, man. You know what, that don't sound like no cop killer to me.

METHOD MAN: For real, for real. You know, there's somethin' powerful about seeing a black man that's bulletproof and unafraid. Come on, y'all. You know? Streets got mad love for Cage. I got mad love for Cage, man, and and he one of ours.

SWAY: But you know what? We got mad love for you, too.

HEATHER B: No doubt.

SWAY: You one of ours, man. You know, the show's almost over, man. You gonna spit for us?

METHOD MAN: Of course.

SWAY: Oh, man! He 'bout to spit! Citizens, you are in for a treat. One of the best to pick up the mic, the one and only Method Man!

METHOD MAN: Hey, yo, Sway. You all ready? I'mma dedicate this one to the hardest individual on the street right now. Luke Cage, you already know. ""Bulletproof Love"" your way, brother.
During this song we see a montage of cops trying to track down Luke Cage, stopping black men with bullet-riddled hoodies. However, the whole of Harlem has started to wear them. Gomez the bodega owner is selling them to a huge crowd.

Let's get it.
Listen.
Man, it is what it is
Can't understand a man if you ain't lived what he lived
Roaches in the crib, ain't got no food up in the fridge
Plus the crime running rampant and it's screwing up the kids
Sway, admit, what kind of paradise is this?
I just want my 40 acres and some carats on the wrist
But these snakes is trying to gather in the pit
When you get a cottonmouth, plucking ashes off the clip
Off the rip, now a challenger exists
And he bulletproof, shoot, what kind of caliber is this?
Got thugs in the store with the barrel on your lips
Saying, ""empty out the drawer"" before he pound you with the grip
Lord, who to call when no one obeys the law
And there ain't no Iron Man that can come and save us all?
Power to the people and Luke Cage the cause
And the cops got it wrong, we don't think Cage involved
Look, dog, a hero, never had one
Already took Malcolm and Martin, this is the last one
I beg your pardon, somebody pulling a fast one
Now we got a hero for hire and he a black one
And bullet-hole hoodies is the fashion
We in Harlem's Paradise, tell the Captain
That I'm about to trade the mic for a Magnum
Give up my life for Trayvon to have one

[Hook: Method Man]
Yeah, 'cause this is bulletproof love
And you already know what a bulletproof does
So you can take it from a bulletproof thug
The hood got his back, dog, bulletproof love
The blood thicker than mud
And who am I to judge if you get a gun in the club?
'Cause you already know what a bulletproof does
When the hood got your back, dog, bulletproof love

[Outro: Method Man]
Yeah, shoutout to Pop. RIP, my brother. The streets is crazy nowadays. People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one whether you like it or not. Luke Cage, please believe it, sir. The streets got your back. You already bulletproof love, baby
The streets is crazy right now, you know what I'm sayin'? People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one. Whether you like it or not, Luke Cage, please believe it, sir, the streets got your back. You're already bulletproof love, baby!

SWAY: Yeah! That was dope. You got it right here on Sway's Universe. The homie, Method Man, HB, and the bulletproof thug, Luke Cage.
Law enforcement is in a frenzy looking for Luke Cage.

THE BARBERSHOP

THEMBI WALLACE NEWSCAST: There have been numerous false sightings, with some people wearing hoodies with holes as a sign of solidarity with an outlaw some people still perceive to be a hero.

SWAY: Sway in the Morning. What's on your mind, citizen?

CALLER: Yo, I remember when Larry Davis was on the run back in the day. Cops came at him 'cause they were just as corrupt, dangerous and jacked up as he was. I don't think we're getting the full story on Luke Cage yet, for real.

Fish is listening to Sway and watching Thembi on the news at the Barbershop.

SWAY: I wouldn't put it past the government, man. Um, you know, we're gonna be searching for the answers for you, and once we get the facts, we're gonna put it right here on Sway's Universe, all right? Thanks for your call, citizen. We got another person on the line...

Fish changes the station to jazz. Plainclothes officers rush in to raid the shop.

OFFICERS: Now! Come on! All right.

FISH: Oh, come on, man. You know he's not here.

Smith walks over to Fish's chessboard.

SMITH: I understand playing against the computer, but, um, how do you beat yourself?

FISH: Chess is a game of anticipation. If you know every single possible move, you can anticipate your adversary's next move before he does.

SMITH: Oh. That's deep. If we find out you've been hiding him, there'll be hell to pay.

FISH: Yeah, well, just don't break the hinges on that door on your way out. I just got it fixed.
The cops drive away. Luke watches them go and comes into the shop.

FISH: That was a close shave.

LUKE: Bad pun.

FISH: What the hell did you even come back for, man?

LUKE: I had to. For Harlem. Take care of Diamondback before he made it bad for everybody.

FISH: Well, forget Harlem. Forget your brother! You're on the road in a brand new car and a woman that fine? And you're bulletproof. You'd have never seen my black ass again. I'd rob the occasional bank and never look back. You got every cop in the city looking for you, brother. Negroes writing Luke Cage ballads and shit. So what's the plan?

LUKE: To box in all the players.

FISH: Well, Shades is in jail. Mariah's out, but she ain't exactly on your side. Now you could tail both of 'em, but no telling how long that'll take for them to lead you to your prey. What about Misty?

LUKE:  No, she's got her hands full already. She's trying to clear my name inside the precinct and bring me in at the same time. We gotta be careful with her.

FISH: That leaves you one other option. Someone else to find Diamondback. Here. Turk.

Fish gets up and goes to the wall phone.

LUKE: Turk may be a pawn, but he's not dumb. If he thinks he's being set up, he'll disappear.

FISH: You let me worry about that. Hey, Turk, it's Bobby. Listen, I might be able to get my hands on about 30 pairs of Jordans. They're the vintage Air Jordan 5s.
Let's just say they fell off the back of a truck...Okay, when?

INTERROGATION ROOM
Ridley walks in with an unfamiliar woman.

SHADES: Who's this?

RIDLEY: First name ""Law,"" last name ""Yer."" Must be pretty damn connected to get a lawyer and not even know who she is.

SHADES: Membership has its privileges.

In the hall, Misty bumps into Shades on his way out.

MISTY: He sprung you? You think this is funny, don't you? You got this all figured out, huh?

SHADES: No. Actually, I don't.

UNDER A BRIDGE
Zip, Shades, and some minions get out of a car.

SHADES: When did Diamondback bring in new hires?

ZIP: Well, after the club, he had to change things up. Recruit some new faces.

They all walk into an abandoned factory.

ZIP: I bet while you were inside, cops tried to do some recruiting of their own.

SHADES: Don't ever question my loyalty.

They all step into a old service elevator.

SHADES: The man upstairs?

ZIP:  You are just full of questions. Matter of fact...

Zip wraps a cord around Shades' neck to strangle him. The other minions wait impassively. Shades struggles until he grabs a minion's gun and starts shooting, taking out the minions before even breaking free from Zip. He turns on Zip last, holding the gun on him.

SHADES: Let's go to the penthouse.

THE ROOF

ZIP: I was just following orders!

SHADES: You're a goddamn puppet. Who gave you the order? Who?

ZIP: Diamondback! You stopped playing your position. Asked too many questions. Diamondback said you needed to be dealt with.

SHADES: Romeo would be ashamed of you. You're such a disappointment.

ZIP: You're the second person who told me that today. I'm my own man, Shades.

SHADES: Tell him yourself.

Shades shoots Zip in the head. He finds the sunglasses in Zip's pocket.

SHADES: Nice...Sorry, Romeo He had to go.

MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE

MARIAH: It's a good thing her friend Leslie knew where she was. I'm glad you found the park. So where is she now?

ALEX: She left with Detective Knight. Traffic got thick and I lost them. I'm sorry. I'm not used to doing anything like this.

MARIAH: We'll find her again. Just knowing that she can't be trusted is helpful. You did a good job, Alex. Hey, you're my rock! Later.

Mariah's phone rings. She puts in an earbud before she answers to speak on her headset.

MARIAH: What do you want?

STRYKER (over the phone): That's no way to speak to a business partner.

MARIAH: After what you did to my club, do you really think I'm gonna shuck and jive with you?

STRYKER (over the phone): You might wanna check your attitude. If you're not of any use to me, then you're not useful to anyone. Shades would tell you, if he was still alive.

MARIAH: What the hell are you talking about?

STRYKER (over the phone): I had to let him go.
So now, I'm giving you the chance to tell me where you stand. I've taken Shades and Damon Boone off the table so you can grow. I'd hate for us to part, too.

MARIAH: I wasn't particularly fond of Shades and the death of Damon Boone, although unnecessary, was appreciated. But you need to know this. I'm out of the political game. I'm focusing on Harlem's Paradise. Using it for a a power base for community relations.

Instead of answering over the phone, Styker comes into the room.

STRYKER: That's a smart move. But you've made some dumb ones also. You should never talk about murder on an open line.

He drops a duffel bag in front of her.

STRYKER: Open it. Seed money for your New Harlem Renaissance project and refurbishing the club. My apologies.

MARIAH: It's a very generous donation but nothing in this world is free.

STRYKER: You're right. My only condition is loyalty. Stick with me and Harlem will be remade in your own image. We'll be doing this for years to come.

MARIAH: Harlem is already in my image. You staying?

STRYKER: Once I'm finished with Carl, I'll evaporate. But don't worry. You'll still feel the occasional cool breeze. Sweet dreams, Mariah.

THE STREETS OF HARLEM
Turk is walking down the street. Luke grabs him and pulls him into an alley.

LUKE: You ratted out Chico. You got Pop killed.

TURK: Man, the writing was on the wall. Somebody would have seen him. Might as well be me. How was I supposed to know Tone was gonna shoot up the shop? Whole damn world know Pop's was Switzerland. Forever.

LUKE: I should crush you.

TURK: You won't, though. You need me.

LUKE: Where's Diamondback?

TURK: I don't know.

Luke picks Turk up and holds him high in the air, then throws him into a dumpster and starts to crush it around Turk's body.

LUKE: You still stalling?

TURK: All right! All right! He's at a warehouse by the Harlem River. Near 145th, all right? I gave you what you wanted! Now let me out!

LUKE: Sit tight, Mr. Barrett. Trash pickup is tomorrow. You can breathe just fine. There's food in there, too.

TURK: You can't leave me in here! There's baby diapers in here, man! Hey! Come on!

DIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE
Domingo and his minions are walking through the abandoned warehouse.

DOMINGO: Looks like you downgraded. I liked the club better.

STRYKER: I'm a man who needs his space.

DOMINGO: Space is a good thing. Especially when you come to kill a man.

STRYKER: Whoa, whoa.

Domingo and his guys pull their guns on the seemingly lone Stryker. Stryker's men emerge from the shadows, equally armed.

DOMINGO: Someone did your boy Zip and his two homies. That's not Cage's style so I'm guessing Shades didn't appreciate you bailing him out.

STRYKER: You know when a rattlesnake is at its most dangerous, Domingo? When it's cornered.

Stryker pulls out his guns and starts shooting. There is a long shootout.

DOMINGO: I'm gonna rip your head off!

Eventually Stryker escapes the melee and goes into another room. He opens a crate and a red glow illuminates his face.

STRYKER: ""And behold a pale horse and he that sat upon him, his name was Death.""
MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE
Mariah is counting Stryker's cash and drinking. She gets up and opens a gold box in her living room that has the pearl-handled gun that Cottonmouth used to kill Uncle Pete. Shades comes into the room.

SHADES: You really need a security system. You waiting for me?

MARIAH: No.

SHADES: I bet he told you I was dead. Diamondback got to you, didn't he?

MARIAH: No, he didn't.

SHADES: What are you doing with a gun? It's not you.

MARIAH: Shut up.

SHADES: I have something for you. Figured you'd want this.

He holds out the bottle she used to hit Cottonmouth over the head when she killed him.

SHADES: Your prints, Cornell's blood.

MARIAH: Then you'll have nothing to blackmail me with.

SHADES: I don't need it. We're in this together now.

MARIAH: You and I have come a long way. You know, sometimes you have to reach across the aisle to get things done.

SHADES: You're talking about Luke Cage? It's incredible how much you and I think alike. We're at war. And right now, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

MARIAH: Maybe. But it might not take. You did beat his ass and give him his powers. And Cornell's flunky killed Pop. You think he really is gonna jump? Just jump on our bandwagon?

SHADES: Absolutely. 'Cause we have something that he wants more than anything.

He pulls an official looking manila envelope out of his bag.

His old life. A chance to clear his name. Right here.

MARIAH: If we send Luke after Diamondback and they kill each other all of our problems are swept away. No matter who wins.

SHADES: Even better.

DIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE
Luke breaks the metal door down and sees the results of the firefight. The warehouse is filled with dead bodies. He finds Domingo Colon, who isn't quite dead yet.

DOMINGO: I should've known you'd turn up.

LUKE: What the hell happened here?

DOMINGO: Diamondback.

Luke hears beeping. He follows it to that side room and finds Stryker's crate. It has a bomb inside with a countdown at 45 seconds.

LUKE: Sweet sister.

Cut to Luke running out of the warehouse carrying Domingo.

LUKE: Slow. Take it easy. What did he use? How did Diamondback do that?

DOMINGO: Something I've never seen before. Even you can't stop him.

Domingo dies.
THE STATIONHOUSE
The shot of Domingo's death becomes a crime scene photo on Misty's wall.

MISTY: These just came in.

BAILEY: Elephant punches all over again.

MISTY: Mmm-hmm.

BAILEY:That's gotta be Cage, right?

Misty's cell phone rings.

MISTY: Hello?

LUKE (over the phone): Hey, it's me. You guys find Domingo?

MISTY: Yeah.

LUKE: Meet me.

MISTY: Where?

She quickly gathers her things and leaves.
THE STREETS OF HARLEM
Misty stops in front of the grated window of an abandoned building. Luke is inside, talking to her through the window.

MISTY: Should I thank you for this?

LUKE: All credit goes to Diamondback.

MISTY: I don't suppose we'll find his body. We found Zip's, though, and two other thugs in an old building. Shot up. Right after they picked up your other boy.

LUKE: Shades. Don't you ever get tired of people getting out?

MISTY: Yes. Look, it's not safe for you to be here. If you don't find Diamondback...

LUKE: Then he wins, and my life is forever a living hell.

MISTY: Is there anything I can do?

LUKE: See what else Turk knows. He's in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd. Near Mount Olivet and the shop.

MISTY: A dumpster?

OUTSIDE MOUNT OLIVET CHURCH
Mariah and Shades are sitting in a car.

MARIAH: Even if we handle Diamondback he's not gonna forgive us for framing him for Cornell's death.

SHADES: We could hurdle that easy. The only people who know what really happened in the club are you and me.

MARIAH: I'll regret that night for the rest of my life.

SHADES: You did what you had to do. You shouldn't regret that.

MARIAH: What were you even doing at the club that night?

SHADES: I was going there to kill him. You beat me to it.

MARIAH: Cornell never needed my political money. And he was never going to pay it back. He just wanted me in all the way.

SHADES: So what are you saying?

MARIAH: He saw things in me that I avoided my whole life. Now I am becoming that person he always saw and I always denied.

SHADES: You ready?

MARIAH: I stay ready, baby.

They climb out of the car and walk into
THE BARBERSHOP

FISH: I should've kept my coat on. Hell just froze over.

MARIAH: Where's Luke Cage?

LUKE: I'm right here.

SHADES:We have a problem.

LUKE: So do I. I can't decide which one of you I'm gonna knock out first. Where's Diamondback?

SHADES: I don't know. The parley between the three of us is more important.

LUKE: You have the nerve to use that term? Right here? Where Pop died? Cough up Diamondback's location, or I'll stomp you like we were back at Seagate.

FISH: Luke, be cool, brother.

MARIAH: Whoa, whoa. No one needs to stomp anyone. Pops made this place Switzerland for a reason. Cage, we have a mutual enemy, and the only way to bring him down is for us all to come together.

LUKE: There's no way I'm helping you.

MARIAH: We came to offer you a truce. In exchange for helping you find Diamondback, you drop your beef with us.

LUKE: You both framed me for murder. There's nothing you can offer me that's going to make me let that go.

SHADES: How about your freedom? Right here is everything you need to prove that Diamondback framed Carl Lucas.

LUKE: Even if Carl Lucas is exonerated Luke Cage is now wanted for the murder of Cottonmouth.

MARIAH: I'll tell them the truth. Diamondback killed Cornell and Damon Boone. You'll go free.

Misty emerges from the back room.

SHADES:What the hell is this?

MISTY: Mariah Dillard, you're under arrest for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

LUKE: I thought you said you were going after Turk?

MISTY: I've been tracking you since you called. I wasn't going to let you just ghost me again.

LUKE: Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shades, back off! Misty, stand down. We're working this out.

MISTY: Oh, so you workin' with them now?

LUKE: He knows where Diamondback is.

SHADES: I didn't say that.

MISTY: Well, whatever you know, Hernan, you should share it with the whole class.

SHADES: I ain't telling you shit.

Something drops to the ground right outside the shop.

LUKE: Grenade!

Everyone drops to the ground (with Luke between them and the door) to cover their heads. The grenade goes off, blowing out all the windows of the shop. In the chaos Misty drops her phone and Shades picks it up. Stryker comes in wearing a green suit and helmet.

FISH: What the hell? What type of Jean Paul Gaultier shit is this? What are you, a pimp stormtrooper?

STRYKER: No, I'm the angel of death.

SHADES (aside to Mariah): You told him to meet us here?

MARIAH: No.

STRYKER: Damn! Look at Hernan the cockroach. Your mama should have named you Pedro.
Shades lifts his gun and fires at Stryker. The bullets ricochet off of his suit.

MARIAH: Shades!

FISH: God damn it! I just fixed this place up all perfect and shit! Y'all can't take this outside?

LUKE & STRYKER: No.

FISH: All right, just just sayin'.

LUKE (to Misty): Don't let Mariah get away.

MISTY: I won't. Kick his ass, Luke.

STRYKER: You know I'm gonna kill 'em all later, right?

LUKE: You have to get past me first.

STRYKER: Oh, I don't go past. I go through.

They both yell and charge each other before the screen goes black.Embed",metal
metal.00053.wav,"Our story begins with the classic 007 opening, except this time it’s Pierce Brosnan wearing the tux.
1 - Ext. Top of Dam - Day
A plane does a fly-by over a dam as a security gate slides open. A man in combat black runs across the top of the tall dam. He clips a rope to his ankle and the railing...and jumps off the side. As he sails down, he pulls out a gun-type thing and shoots it. A wire follows attaching in concrete and pulling the man down to....
“Archangel Chemical Weapons Facility, USSR”
Cut to a laser burning through a metal wall, being shot by the man with the gunthing. We see a blue eye, but we haven’t seen this guy’s face yet.....
2 - Int. Bathroom - Day
Inside the plant, we cut to the men’s room, where we see Russians walking around. Above one of the stalls...
“Man in black’s” P.O.V. - a Soviet in uniform sitting on the can, reading a newspaper titled Pravda (""The Truth"").
The man in black takes the steel grate out and we see a silhouette. Soviet’s P.O.V. - The newspaper, printed in Russian, duh. He pulls the paper back to reveal.... James Bond. Hanging upside down from a vent. He flashes a grin.
BOND: Beg your pardon, forgot to knock.
007 punches out the Soviet and slips down.
3 - Int. Hallway - Same time
Bond slips un-noticed through dim halls, wielding his Walther PPK with a silencer on it. He spots a butcher loading meat onto a cart, and he walks up to an opening where he sees soldiers eating. As he turns away...another dark shadow points a gun at him...and says something.
SHADOW: (Russian) Where have you been? Where are your companions?
BOND: I’m alone.
Alec Trevelyan, 006, steps into the light. He's around Bond's general age and built. Blond with cold eyes...
ALEC: Aren’t we all? You’re late 007.
BOND: I had to stop in the bathroom.
ALEC: Ready to save the world again?
BOND: After you, 006.
They remove another steel grate.
ALEC: James, for England.
BOND: For England, Alec.
4 - Int. Hall - Day
Bond’s blue eyes spot someone in the hall. Waiting ‘til the coast is clear, he jumps out of the vent in the floor while Alec climbs out. Both men walk down the hall. Alec enters a laboratory with a plate-glass window and shoots the guy inside. Meanwhile, Bond has a device plugged into and ID card slot with a number pad under it. He waits for a click,
and the door unlocks. Both men walk inside....
5 - Int. Gas room - Day
...A room filled with nerve gas tanks.
BOND: It’s too easy.
ALEC: Half of everything is luck, James.
Alec turns and plugs the device into the same panel, jamming the door.
BOND: And the other half?
ALEC: Fate!
A red light sounds, signaling the alarm of the plant. The men run down the stairs.
ALEC: Set timers to six minutes!
BOND: Six minutes, check.
A few Soviets burst through a door, 006 shoots them. Bond starts to arm a little explosive timer. A digital clock pops up...6.00. James and Alec scurry around behind the gas tanks planting the timers. An ugly-looking Soviet commander, Ourumov, stands behind a plexi-glass window.
OURUMOV:  FIRE!
Soldiers fire their guns, breaking the window. 006 and 007 are still planting the timers.
ALEC: Closing time, James! Last call!
BOND: Buy me a pint!
The Soviets pour through the opening. Trevelyan fires at them.
OURUMOV (O.S.): I am Colonel Ourumov. Come out with your hands above your heads!
While planting a timer...
BOND: How original.
More Soviets pour through a door.
BOND: Shut the door, Alec! There’s a draft!
No answer.
BOND: Alec?!
He looks for 006. Alec in kneeling under the gun of Ourumov. Thirty soldiers all have their guns pointed at Bond.
OURUMOV:  Move out! Throw down your weapon and walk towards me. Slowly.
ALEC: Finish the job, James! Blow them all to hell!
OURUMOV:  You have 10 seconds. 10...9...8...
Bond goes back to the detonator he just planted and sets it for 3.00.
OURUMOV:  ....7...6..5...4..
Bond throws his weapon on the floor, puts his hands behind his head and approaches Ourumov.
OURUMOV:  ...3......2....
ALEC: For England, James!!
BOOM. Alec is silenced. He flops over. The Soviet soldiers fire their automatic rifles.
Bond retreats behind the tanks again.
OURUMOV:  Hold your fire! You’ll blow the gas tanks!
They do. Bond recovers his gun.
OURUMOV:  This is your last chance! Come out with your hands above your head....
Ourumov’s P.O.V. - a dark shadow moves behind a cart with tanks piled on it. The soldiers raise their guns...
OURUMOV:  WAIT!
Bond moves slowly with the cart acting as a shield. Ourumov seems amused....one soldier thinks he can get a shot off...and fires. Bond retreats farther behind the cart. Ourumov turns and shoots the guy in the face...he warned him.
OURUMOV:  You can’t win.
Yeah, sure. Bond quickly hits the “on” button to a conveyer belt leading outside. He jumps on and fires the assault rifle. The Soviets fire back, but Bond hits the grate to a storage area above their heads. More gas tanks pour out on the Soviets. And Bond tumbles down the conveyer belt onto...
6 - Ext. Runway - Day
Bond sees a small plane....his ticket outta here. More soldiers burst through a hangar door and what’s behind door number 2...even more pour out onto the runway. Bond crouches behind some piping and fires, hitting a few. The gun runs out and he dashes through the snow toward the plane. We hear Ourumov’s shouting in the backround.
OURUMOV:  Hold your fire!
Cut to 1000 yards out: the facility is on a mountain-top. Cliffs, very high up. Back to the action...Bond runs down the plane and drags himself inside, fights with the pilot. Now there’s soldiers chasing Bond on motorcycles. Both 007 and the pilot tumble out of the plane. A motorcycle runs over the pilot, causing the bike to throw its rider. Bond
jumps on the bike and chases the runaway plane.
OURUMOV:  WAIT!!
The plane sails off the cliff, and so does the motorcycle with 007 still on it. He flies off the bike and sails to the dive-bombing plane. He grabs the open door and pulls himself inside and into the pilot’s seat. Uh-oh! The stick’s not working, not responding! Oh crap!
We see Bond’s blue eyes start to panic...then just in time the plane soars upward as the chemical weapons facility explodes.
Fade up on...

Title Sequence, scored by “GoldenEye” sung by Tina Turner

7 - Int. Car/Ext. Road - Day
We shoot onto an open road with the vrroom of an engine behind us. James’ personal choice of car, a silver Aston Martin DB5, license plate BMT 216A. The DB5 swerves around a tight corner at 90 mph. Fade up title...
“Nine Years Later”
Bond, of course, is behind the wheel and a young woman sits beside him, visibly agitated. Her name is Caroline, but it doesn’t come up in the text.
CAROLINE: James, is it really necessary to drive quite so fast?!
BOND: More often than you’d think.
A red Ferrari comes into view in the rear mirror.
CAROLINE: I enjoy a spirited ride as much as the next girl...
James flashes an intoxicating grin...as the Ferrari pulls up beside him. There’s a beautiful brunette behind the wheel. James loves this...
CAROLINE: Who’s that?
BOND: The next girl.
The Ferrari passes him and plays a little road rash...nearly crashing into an oncoming tractor, spinning out of the way. James is loving every minute. Caroline is now really pissed off...
CAROLINE: James, stop this! Stop it! I know what you’re doing...
BOND: Really? What’s that, dear?
CAROLINE: You’re just trying to show off the size of your...your...
BOND: Engine?
CAROLINE: Ego.
BOND: Here we are having a pleasant drive in the country and you’ve got to bring psychology into it.
CAROLINE: Well, I was just sent out here to evaluate you.
BOND: Let’s try and put that behind us, shall we?
The DB5 and Ferrari are still doin’ 90 around a corner when a pack of cyclists are pedaling up a hill. 007 let’s the car pass him...
BOND: Ladies first.
Caroline seems to be praying. The red Ferrari brushes past the first biker, knocking him down and the rest fall over in succession. Caroline’s had enough.
CAROLINE: James, I want you to stop this car!
BOND: Really?
CAROLINE: STOP THIS CAR AT ONCE!!
James pulls the brake and the car screeches to a halt. He puts his arm around her.
BOND: As you can see, I have no problem with female authority.
She flips open a box with two glasses and a bottle of Bollinger champagne in it. She looks pleased for once.
CAROLINE: James, you’re incorrigible. What am I going to do with you?
He moves in closer....
BOND: Let’s toast your evaluation, shall we?
They kiss...
BOND: A very...thorough...evaluation.
She giggles, they kiss and we pan up on the skyline of Monte Carlo.
8 - Ext. Posh party - Night
The Astor Martin DB5 drives up to a elegant-looking hotel, with a parking valet.
VALET: (French) Good evening Mr. Bond. Nice to see you tonight.
BOND: (French) Good evening, Pierre. How are things?
Valet: (French) Very good, and you?
Bond steps out of the DB5, looking dashing as usual in a tailored tuxedo, his black hair combed back. He spots the red Ferrari, parked. He enters the casino.
8 - Int. Hotel/Casino - Night
Bond enters a ritzy lobby and nears a baccarat table. The dealer and a couple of people sit around playing.
DEALER: Sept à la banque. Ma’dam wins.
We pan up on the driver of the expensive Italian sports car, who wears a black dress. Her name is Xenia Onatopp.
DEALER: Mademoiselle? Monsieurs. Ladies and Gentlemen? Players.
Bond sits down at the table as Xenia is lighting up a cigar.
BOND: Banko.
They proceed to play the game.
BOND: It appears we share the same passions. Well, three anyway.
XENIA:  I count two. Motoring and...uh...baccarat.
She shows he cards
DEALER: Huit à la banque.
Bond shows his cards.
DEALER: Seven. Ma’dam wins.
XENIA:  I hope the third is where your real talent lies.
BOND: One rises to meet a challenge.
They place their bets.
XENIA:  Doubler.
BOND: Suivi.
The dealer nods his head and passes cards. Bond looks at them.
BOND: Carte.
Xenia shows her cards.
DEALER: Ma’dam stands with five.
Bond shows his cards.
DEALER: Six. Ma’dam loses.
Xenia is obviously mad.
XENIA:  (Russian)Dammit! (English) Enjoy it. While it lasts.
BOND: The very words I live by.
She gets up from the table. James follows.
BOND: And what words do you live by?
XENIA:  The trick is to quit while you’re still ahead.
BOND: That’s one trick I never learned.
He signals for a waiter to come over.
BOND: Perhaps you’ll show me how it’s done.
The waiter approaches them. Here we go folks....
BOND: Vodka Martini. Shaken, not stirred. And for you?
XENIA:  The same.
Bond is entranced.
BOND: How do you take it?
XENIA:  Straight up. With a twist.
The waiter scurries away. Xenia fingers her cigar. So, she likes to play...
XENIA:  Thank you, Mr....
BOND: The name’s Bond. James Bond.
XENIA:  Xenia Zargeneva Onatopp.
BOND: Onatopp?
XENIA:  Onatopp.
BOND: Your accent, Georgian?
XENIA:  Very good Mr. Bond. You’ve been to Russia?
BOND: Not recently, I used to drop in occasionally. Shoot in and out.
XENIA:  It’s very different now. The land of opportunity.
BOND: With a new Ferrari in every garage?
XENIA:  No, not quite. That belongs to a friend.
BOND: A tip for your friend: the French registration plates for this year’s models start with the letter ‘L’. Even the counterfeit ones.
Xenia is startled.
XENIA:  Oh, and what rank do you hold with the Motor Vehicles Department, Mr. Bond?
BOND: Commander.
Now a man steps up to Xenia. He’s a bald dude with a red beard. Looks like a  Canadian Admiral.
ADMIRAL: Should we go?
XENIA:  This one is an Admiral.
BOND: I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank.
XENIA:  Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.
She sounds really annoyed, and she storms away with the Canadian. Bond watches her.
BOND: The pleasure, I’m sure, was all mine.
9 - Ext. Amphitheater - Night
People are gathered on stone benches in an open amphitheater watching two ladies perform an act. One woman hands a rose to another girl dressed as a porcelain doll. The lady proceeds to control the ‘doll’ as she walks like a puppet over to a man in the audience. He takes it and the audience claps. Meanwhile, Bond walks up the stone stairs to the top of the theater, overlooking water. Bond’s P.O.V. - the Ferrari pulls up, and Xenia and the Admiral get out. Bond takes out a camera-thing from his pocket, and zooming in, he takes a picture of Xenia and the Canadian boarding a motorboat to take her to a yacht. Bond takes a picture of the boat - ‘Manticore’- and walks back to his DB5.
10 - Ext. DB5 / Int. DB5 - Night
Before Bond gets into his car, he notices a very sophisticated, stealthy helicopter perched on top of a battleship. He gets in the car and pushes a button on the stereo. A piece of paper with the info of the pictures he just took. A voice starts...it’s Moneypenny. Bond looks at the pictures.
MONEYPENNY: (V.O.) Transmission begins from Monypenny. Identification confirmed. Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot. Current suspected links to the Janus crime syndicate, St. Petersburg. Yacht Manticore is leased to a known Janus corporate front. M authorizes you to observe Miss Onatopp but stipulates no...contact...without prior
approval. End transmission, Moneypenny. Good night, James. I trust you’ll stay...onatopp of things.
Bond smirks. He knows exactly what she means. So do we....
11 - Int. Yacht Manticore - Night
Xenia literally JUMPS on the Admiral. She’s in some black lingerie. They kiss ferociously, she bites him. Then she whispers something, flips him over and crushes his rib cage with her legs. The Admiral’s in a lot of PAIN.
ADMIRAL: Xenia! I can’t BREATHE!!!
Xenia grins and squeezes harder. A hand reaches into the Admiral’s coat, which is draped over a chair, and pulls out his Department of Defense ID card.
12 - Ext. Bay - Day
A motorboat speeds through the water.
13 - Ext. Yacht Manticore - Day
Bond waits for a man in a striped shirt to pass before he jumps up on to the deck on the yacht. He walks toward a sliding glass door, opens it and enters.
14 - Int. Yacht Manticore - Day
Furnished with leather furniture, Bond makes his way to a window where he sees the motorboat speeding to the battleship with the chopper on the deck. He looks down into a brass doorknob and sees the reflection of the guy in the striped shirt coming at him. Bond spins around with a towel and knocks him down, then throws him down the stairs by wrapping the towel around his head. 007 wipes his face with the towel.
15 - Ext. Battleship - Day
Across the bay, cars let off Naval, Army and Air Force Officers of different countries, as well as their escorts. A gloved hand shows the Admiral’s ID card for the Department of National Defense. We’re pretty sure it isn’t the Admiral... A band plays, officers mill around. The Captain salutes the ‘Admiral’.
CAPTAIN: My respects, Admiral.
The officer kisses the hand of Xenia, who is standing beside the ‘Admiral’.
CAPTAIN: Delighted to have you aboard, mademoiselle.
An emcee starts to talk.
M.C.: Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats on the upper deck for the demonstration of the aircraft.
16 - Int. Yacht - Day
Bond is still looking around the boat, this time with the Walther drawn. He bursts through a door, looks in a cabinet. He’s in a bedroom now. James opens the closet door and...  The dead body of Admiral Chuck Farrel falls stiffly to the floor, naked. Bond is a little stunned...
17 - Ext. Yacht - Day
Bond hops into a motorboat docked beside the yacht. He starts it up and drives toward the warship.
18 - Ext. Battleship - Day
We see the chopper up close now...jeez! air-to-air missiles, heat-seekers, guns up the wazoo...the whole nine yards.
M.C.: What you are about to see in operation is Europe’s answer to the electronic battlefield. The first working prototype of the Tiger helicopter. Uniquely maneuverable, the Tiger not only uses stealth technology, it is the only helicopter to be hardened against all forms of electronic interference, radio jamming and electro-magnetic radiation.
19 - Int. Hall - Day
Two pilots in blue flight suits, clutching helmets make their way outside to the chopper. They are stopped by Xenia, wearing a revealing dress. She whistles to get their attention. The pilots turn. She speaks seductively...
XENIA:  Shh. I have a small surprise from your friends back at the barracks.
One pilot turns to the other and grins.
PILOT: I think I’ve gone to Heaven!
XENIA:  Not yet.
She whips out a pistol and shoots both of them. Xenia is shown next wearing one of the blue flight suits and the helmet with the visor down.
20 - Ext. Landing Pad - Day
M.C. (O.S.): Now let’s welcome the pilots...Lt. Commander Bernard Jobert and Lt. Francois Bruse.
The ‘pilots’ wave and board the helicopter. Bond is now on the warship RUNNING toward the Tiger, but he is pushed against the wall by 2 burly guards. They all watch the Tiger take off. Fade out....
21 - Ext. Northern Russia - Evening
A dog team runs through the snow near...Fade up title...
“Space Weapons Control Centre, Severnaya, Russia”
A desolate area, wind blowing snow around a building with a HUGE satellite dish on top of it.
22 - Int. Weapons Centre - Evening
A bunch of monitors, computers, electronic map of the world occupy the area. We hear a voice..
WOMAN (O.S.): Select MIR. Autographic projection.
We pan to the right to reveal Natalya Simonova, a beautiful computer programmer, seated at a computer with postcards of a tropical beach taped to the side.
NATALYA: Compute possible intercept with second stage geo-set two.
Whatever that means. We show the monitor. Up pops a window “Enter Password” along with a graphic of a woman in a bikini. Natalya sighs and looks at a guy in a chair, playing with a pen like an idiot. Leather jacket, greasy hair, wire-rim glasses. This program was obviously designed by this dude. Natalya looks to the woman behind her.
NATALYA: Anna.
Anna looks up from her monitor and is obviously disgusted.
ANNA: He wouldn’t know a woman if one came up and sat on his head!
Natalya laughs.
NATALYA: Bor-ris!
Boris is still playing with the pen.
NATALYA: BORIS!
BORIS: What?
She signals to her monitor.
BORIS: I thought I’d post it on the Internet, no?
NATALYA: What’s the password?
BORIS: I made it easy this time. Even you should be able to break it, borsht-for-brains. Alright, alright, I’ll give you a hint. They’re right in front of you, and can open very large doors.
She types in “Knockers”.
NATALYA: You’re such a geek.
We hear an alarm. They turn to Boris’ computer.
BORIS: Yes! I’m in!
He rolls over to his P.C. and grins.
NATALYA: You’ve hacked into the U.S. Department on Justice. You know what will happen if they trace it here?
BORIS: The Chief of Computers will call me a genius, move me to Moscow, and give me a million bucks hard currency. I think not. Besides, the Americans are slugheads, they’ll never detect me.
Up pops a window “Unauthorized Access Detected”.
NATALYA: You’re saying, slughead.
BORIS: Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko.
He types something and up pops a window “Send Spike”.
BORIS: Spiked them!
NATALYA: Come on, Boris...
BORIS: No way! I spiked them!
“Initiate Search Program. Enter Password”.
NATALYA: Alright, what’s the password?
BORIS: I’m not going to tell you.
NATALYA: OK, let me guess. It’s not in front of me?
Boris shakes his head.
BORIS: You sit on it, but you can’t take it with you.
Boris types in 5 characters. A map pops up on-screen. A red line connects cities.
BORIS: My program seizes the phone line of whoever’s tracing me and jams their modem so they get hung up. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
An F.B.I. screen pops up.
BORIS: Whoo!
He types....
BORIS: “Better luck next time, Slugheads!” BAM! GONE! I am invincible!!
Boris leaps up triumphantly with his arms in the air. Other technicians just look at him. He turns to Natalya.
BORIS: Was it good for you, too?
She’s annoyed with him.
NATALYA: I’m getting some coffee.
She walks away.
BORIS: I’m going for a cigarette.
23 - Ext. Facility - Evening
A sliding door opens and Boris outside with a parka on. Buurrr! Cold! He bites a beat-up cigarette and lights a zippo. The lighter blows out, and Boris looks up and sees... The Tiger helicopter fighting the wind, landing in the snow. The cockpit opens, Xenia and Ourumov jump out.
24 - Int. Severnaya Kitchen - Evening
Natalya is getting a cup of coffee.
25 - Int. Hallway - Evening
Xenia and Ourumov walk down a hallway and stop at a little box on the wall: a voice-identification system.
OURUMOV:  General Akadi Gregorovich Ourumov, head of Space Division.
A door opens. Xenia and Ourumov enter...
26 - Int. Severnaya Control Room - Evening
A soldier hurries to address the General. He salutes.
MAJOR: General, if I’d known...
OURUMOV:  You’d have been ready. This is an unscheduled test of the Severnaya facility, Major. War simulation. We are going to test via GoldenEye. Report the status.
MAJOR: Two operational satellites, Sir. Petya and Mischa. Both in 90 minute Earth orbit at 100 kilometers.
OURUMOV:  Good.
He takes out an authority card.
OURUMOV: Here is the authorization code. Now the GoldenEye and today’s access numbers for satellite Petya, please.
He looks at his watch.
OURUMOV:  I am timing you.
The Major scurries away, slides the card through a slot and presses his hand on an ID pad. The metal wall opens...revealing a square disk with a large golden crystal in the center: The GoldenEye. The Major takes the GoldenEye and two keys from its safe and hands them to the General.
OURUMOV:  Good. Thank you, Major.
Natalya notices something is going on from her position in the kitchen. Xenia cocks an automatic rifle and shoots every technician in the room. She is visibly enjoying herself. Natalya is still in the kitchen, scared to death. Bodies of her co-workers lay everywhere. Ourumov walks toward a large control panel and slides the GoldenEye in a slot, and
hands a key to Xenia. They slide the keys in...
OURUMOV:  On my count...3...2...1!
They turn the keys at the same time. It activates the electronic map on the wall.
OURUMOV:  Set target. Severnaya.
Xenia types in something. Russia lights up in red.
OURUMOV:  Arm the weapon.
She types once again. Ourumov flips a plastic cover and twists the red dial inside.
27 - Space
A satellite in orbit breaks off its protective cover. CCCP is printed on the side.
28 - Int. Control Room - Evening
Xenia types in a firing code.
29 - Space
The satellite spreads its thrusters.
30 - Int. Control Room - Evening
An alarm sounds “Weapon Armed”. They hear a noise, and Natalya runs back into the kitchen.
OURUMOV:  Check it.
Xenia grabs her gun and runs down to a person who managed to send a distress signal. She shoots him again.
31 - Int. Kitchen - Evening
Natalya notices a vent in the ceiling. Maybe she can escape that way....
32 - Int. Control Room - Evening
OURUMOV:  Their best response time is 19 minutes. They’ll be late.
33 - Ext. Russian Air Base - Evening
Three pilots sprint to their aircrafts while an alarm sounds.
34 - Int. Control Room - Evening
Xenia decides to check the kitchen. She notices some spilled coffee. She bends down and touches it, still hot. She spots the opened vent in the ceiling and fires at it. Meanwhile, Ourumov secures the GoldenEye and keys inside a briefcase. Both walk out.
XENIA:  It’s clean. I had to ventilate someone.
We see a digital timer counting down.
35 - Space
The satellite moves into position.
36 - Ext. Facility - Evening
Xenia and the General load into the chopper and take off.
37 - Ext. Air base - Evening
The three MiGs take off.
38 - Ext. MI6 building - Night
We see the MI6 building as a double-decker bus passes.
39 - Int. Moneypenny’s office - Night
Bond makes his way to Miss Moneypenny’s office. She’s inside wearing an elegant black dress. James loves this.
BOND: Good evening, Moneypenny.
She looks up and sees James standing in the doorway.
MONEYPENNY: Good evening, James. M will meet you in the situation room. I’m to take you straight in.
She walks past him. He watches.
BOND: I’ve never seen you after hours, Moneypenny, lovely.
MONEYPENNY: Thank you, James.
BOND: Out on some professional assignment? Dressing to kill?
They start to walk down a hall.
MONEYPENNY: I know you’ll find this crushing, 007, but I don’t sit at home every night praying for some international incident so I can run down here all dressed up to impress James Bond. I was on a date, if you must know, with a gentleman. We went to the theater together.
She presses a few buttons.
BOND: Moneypenny, I’m devastated. What would I ever do without you?
MONEYPENNY: As far as I can remember, James, you’ve never had me.
The elevator stops and they step out. Bond moves in closer.
BOND: Hope, spring is eternal.
MONEYPENNY: You know, this sort of behavior could qualify as sexual harassment.
BOND: Really, what’s the penalty for that?
MONEYPENNY: Someday you have to make good on your innuendoes.
Another door slides open. James keeps staring at her.
BOND: After you, Moneypenny.
MONEYPENNY: No, I insist. You first.
Bond walks through the door into...
40 - Int. Situation room - Night
Common “Situation Room”. Satellite photo on the wall, computers, monitors everywhere.
Bill Tanner approaches Bond.
TANNER: Good Evening, Mr. Bond.
BOND: Tanner, What’s up?
TANNER: Sixteen minutes ago, we intercepted a distress call from a supposedly abandoned radar station at Severnaya. Look what the satellite picked up.
We see a satellite photo on a computer monitor. Pictured is what looks like a bird’s-eye-view of a helicopter. They zoom in on the image.
TANNER (O.S.): We found a match. Your missing Tiger.
The computer does a scan of the aircraft.
BOND (O.S.): In the middle of northern Russia.
TANNER: Seems like your hunch was right, 007. Too bad the evil queen of numbers won’t let you play it.
Bond clears his throat, signaling that she’s right behind him. Tanner cringes, and turns around...slowly. There’s M. A woman with short gray hair, face as hard as stone and a disposition to match.
M: You were saying?
TANNER: No, I was just...uh...
M: Good, because if I want sarcasm, Mr. Tanner, I’ll talk to my children, thank you very much. (Pause) Good evening, 007.
BOND: Good evening, M.
M: The Prime Minister’s waiting for an update. Proceed with your briefing, Mr. Tanner.
TANNER: Thank you. After the distress signal, your helicopter took off, and the Russians scrambled these three MiGs here to intercept it.
He walks to the satellite photo on the wall.
BOND (O.S.): What do you think the Russians were using the base for?
TANNER: Well at one point, we suspected that Severnaya might be the ground station for a secret space-based weapon system called GoldenEye, but...
M: Our statistical analysis saw they had neither the finance or technology to implement it.
BOND: Numbers were never my strong suite.
M just stares at him.
BOND: Are these pictures live?
Tanner starts to say something when...
M: Unlike the American government, we prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.
41 - Ext. Russian sky - Night
The three MiGs soar through the sky at Mach 2.
42 - Int. Severnaya kitchen - Night
We see a cabinet door open, a pair of eyes peek out. Natalya crawls out.
43 - Ext. Russian sky - Night
The MiGs do a fly-by of the Severnaya facility.
MiG Pilot: Negative, so far. Everything seems normal.
44 - Int. Severnaya - Night
Natalya stands among the bodies of her late co-workers. An alarm sounds. “Time to target...3...2...1!” Oh crap.
45 - Space
The satellite gives off a blinding light and a pulse surges.
46 - Ext. Severnaya - Night
A surge ripples though the ground and the dish begins to short circuit.
47 - Int. Severnaya - Night
Electrical explosions fill the room, and Natalya runs and dives under a metal staircase.
48 - Int. MI6 Situation Room - Night
The satellite picture on the wall fizzles out. Nothing but static.
TANNER: What the bloody hell was that?
M is in deep thought.
49 - Ext. Russian sky - Night
The MiGs start to short circuit, all the controls go haywire, the pilot screams. The jet goes down, two explode in mid-air. The third is still careening toward the dish. It crashes into it and explodes.
50 - Int. Severnaya -Night
A pipe breaks right next to Natalya’s head. She leaps up from her hiding place, screaming. She trips on a body and falls. Above her, the rig holding up a bunch of TV monitors comes crashing down, and stops just before crushing her.
51 - Ext. Severnaya - Night
The dish is still exploding....
52 - Int. Severnaya - Night
Natalya covers up Anna with a cloth. She’s crying now as she walks to the little voice ID box in the hallway.
NATALYA: Natalya Fiodorovna Simonova.
The bars don’t move, duh, the box is obviously busted.
NATALYA: NATALYA FIODOROVNA SIMONOVA!!!
She hears a creak above her. She looks up and walks away. The dish comes CRASHING down, through the roof! Natalya’s really scared now...but...
53 - Ext. Severnaya - Night
Natalya climbs out the newly revealed exit. From afar we see her, surrounded by fire.
NATALYA: Boris!? Boris!?
54 - Int. MI6 Situation Room - Night
Tanner’s on the phone.
TANNER: Thanks.
He hangs up.
TANNER: Our satellite’s knocked out. So are two of the Americans’. We have another coming into range...now.
The satellite picture on the wall comes back on.
TANNER: Good God. Two of the MiGs are down...
They look at a monitor.
M: And it looks like the third went into the dish.
M turns to Bond, who is still studying the wall.
M: What do you think?
BOND: No lights. Not one single electric light on a thirty-mile radius. (Pause) EMP?
TANNER: Would account for the MiGs and the satellite.
BOND: And the blackout.
Tanner turns to M.
TANNER: Electro-Magnetic Pulse. First strike satellite weapon developed by the...uh..
M: The Americans and Soviets during the Cold War. I read the brief. Discovered after Hiroshima. Set off a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere, creates a pulse; a radiation surge that destroys everything with an electronic circuit.
TANNER: The idea being to knock out the enemy’s communication before he, she or they could retaliate.
M: So, GoldenEye exists.
BOND: Yes.
M: Could this be an accident?
BOND: No. The helicopter. If you wanted to steal the GoldenEye it’s the perfect getaway vehicle. Setting off the blast was the ideal way to wipe out any trace of the crime.
M: The Janus Group?
BOND: They may have been involved with the helicopter.
He moves to a computer.
BOND: I know the Russian fail-safe systems. You just can’t walk in and ask for the keys to he bomb. You need the access codes.
On the computer, James zooms in on a small white object, moving. It appears to be a person. (It’s Natalya)
BOND (O.S.): There had to be an insider.
He looks closer at the monitor.
BOND: And at least one person probably knows who it is.
55 - Ext. Severnaya - Night
Natalya falls into the snow. She hears sled dogs, she runs toward them. We see a dog team.
56 - Int. M’s Office - Night
M is on the phone.
M: Very well, Sir. Thank you, good night.
She hangs up and turns to Bond.
M: The Prime Minister’s talked to Moscow. They’re saying it was an accident during a routine training exercise.
007 is seated in a chair, hands folded neatly
BOND: Governments change. The lies stay the same.
M walks around from behind her desk.
M: What else do we know about the Janus Syndicate?
BOND: Top-flight arms dealers headquartered in St. Petersburg. First outfit to reach north the Iraqis during the Gulf War. Their head man in unreliably described, no photographs. The woman, Onatopp, is our only confirmed contact.
M: Would you care for a drink?
BOND: Um...thank you. Your predecessor kept some Cognac in the top drawer…
M: I prefer Bourbon.
She pours the drinks.
M: Ice?
BOND: Yes.
She hands a glass to him.
M: We pulled the files on anyone who might had access or authority at Severnaya. Top name on our list is a friend of yours, I understand...
She sits at her desk and presses a button. A screen in back of her appears with Ourumov’s ugly face on it.
BOND: Ourumov. They made him a general.
M: He sees himself as the next ‘I’ man if Russia. Which is why our political analysts rule him out. He doesn’t fit the profile of a traitor.
Bond is a little annoyed...
BOND: Are these the same analysts who said GoldenEye couldn’t exist, who said the helicopter posed no immediate threat, and wasn’t worth following?!
M: You don’t like me, Bond. You don’t like my methods. You think I’m an accountant, a bean counter, more interested in my members than your instincts.
BOND: The thought had occurred to me.
M: Good, because I think you’re a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the Cold War, whose boyish charms though wasted on me obviously appeal to the young woman I sent out to evaluate you.
Bond takes a sip of his drink.
BOND: Point taken.
M: Not quite, 007.
She’s got his attention.
M: If you think for one moment I don’t have the balls to send a man out to die, your instincts are dead wrong. I have no compunction about sending you to your death. But I won’t do it on a whim. Even with your cavalier attitude toward life.
She leans forward on her desk...
M: I want you to find GoldenEye, find who took it, what they plan to do with it and stop it. And if you should come across Ourumov, guilty or not, I don’t want you running off on some kind of vendetta. Avenging Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.
BOND: You didn’t get him killed.
M: Neither did you. Don’t make it personal.
BOND: (mumbles) Never.
He finishes his drink and gets up. He’s had enough of this...
M (O.S.): Bond.
James turns. M smirks.
M: Come back alive.
57 - Ext. St. Petersburg square - Day
A band plays in a square outside The Winter Palace, the residence of the Russian Czar until 1918.
58 - Int. Building - Day
Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin watches the band marching from a window. A serious-looking dude with a gotee. He glances at his watch, then retreats back to a table with a board of councilors seated. There’s a knock at the door. Gen. Ourumov enters and removes his hat.
MISHKIN: Good morning, General Ourumov.
OURUMOV:  Defense Minister Mishkin, Gentlemen.
MISHKIN: Please, deliver your report.
OURUMOV:  As this council is aware, 72 hours ago, a secret weapons program codename GoldenEye was detonated over Severnaya. As head of Space Division, I personally undertook the investigation. I have concluded this crime was committed by Siberian separatists, seeking to create political unrest. Incredibly the peaceful work and much needed hard currency earnings of Severnaya have been set back by several years. Therefore, I tender my resignation.
The council makes some noise, shaking their heads ""Niet"" ""No"".
MISHKIN: It seems the council does not want your head, Akadi Gregorovich, merely your loyal assurance that there are no other GoldenEye satellites.
OURUMOV:  I can’t give you that assurance, Defense Minister.
MISHKIN: And what of the two missing Severnaya technicians?
Ourumov freezes. Two?! Where did two come from?!
OURUMOV:  I was aware only of the one. Boris Grishenko.
Mishkin glances at a paper...
MISHKIN: There was a girl, also, whose body was not among the dead. Natalya Fivoriva Simonova, a level-two programmer.
OURUMOV:  I will investigate immediately, Defense Minister.
MISHKIN: It would seem presumptuous, General, to blame this incident on Siberian separatists before the whereabouts of your own people are determined.
The Council looks like a bunch of statues.
MISHKIN: Do you agree?
OURUMOV:  YES, Defense Minister. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
MISHKIN: That will be all.
The General snaps to attention and puts his hat back on, then exits.
59 - Int. Q Branch - Day, I think...
Bond makes his way to Q’s test lab. The room is full of technicians working on all sorts of gadgets. Q himself wheels up in a wheelchair with a cast on his left leg.
BOND: Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?
A rocket fires from the cast, exploding in a bright flash.
Q: Hunting!
Across the room a parachute discharges from a BMW. Q and 007 walk toward the car.
Q: Right! Now pay attention, 007. First, your new car. BMW. Agile five-forward gears, all points radar. Self-destruct system, and naturally, all the usual refinements.
As Q talks, James opens the car door. Blue BMW Z3 Roadster convertible. James proceeds to bug the technician working on the car. He is, of course, not listening to Q.
Q: Now this, I’m particularly proud of: behind the headlights - Stinger missiles.
Bond is now listening...
BOND: Excellent! Just the thing for unwinding after a rough day at the office.
Q: Need I remind you, 007, that you have a license to kill - NOT to break the traffic laws.
BOND: I wouldn’t think of it.
Q: Good! Right, let’s get on to more practical methods.
They walk to a table. Bond disappears off-screen. Q picks up a belt.
Q: A typical leather belt. Male size 34, buckle - notch.
We see Bond now, he’s playing with a laptop, not listening as usual.
Q: Are you finished?
James quickly closes the laptop, pauses...
BOND: Yes.
Q: Good! A typical leather belt...
BOND: Q! I’m familiar with that device.
Q: Not one with a 75-foot repelling cord built into the buckle. Fire, and out shoots a pitot followed by a high tensile wire designed to support your weight.
BOND: I see. And what if I need additional support?
Q: It’s tested for one, 007.
Behind them, a guy in a white lab coat enters a fake phone booth. An air-bag thing inflates, trapping the guy inside. Bond and Q could care less. Q picks up an envelope Bond has been carrying with him. An x-ray of the envelope appears on a monitor. Looks like a plane ticket. British Airways.
Q: Flight 878 to St. Petersburg.
Q taps a mirrored table.
Q: X-ray document scanner.
He takes out a ‘clickey pen’ (ya know the kind you have to click to use).
Q: A pen. This is a class-4 grenade. Three clicks arms the four second fuse, another three disarms it.
As he talks, Q demonstrates the clicks. Bond grabs the pen and clicks it three times.
BOND: How long did you say the fuse was?
Q grabs it back, and disarms it.
Q: Oh, grow up 007.
BOND: Who said the pen was mightier than the sword?
Q: Thanks to me, they were right!
Q walks toward a test dummy while the man stuck in the telephone booth is being wheeled away.
Q: Look, let’s ask Fred here to demonstrate for us.
He clips the pen in “Fred’s” pocket as the guy trapped in the phone booth is wheeled away.
Q: Here we are. Sorry about this Fred...
Q clicks the pen three times.
Q: 1...2...3!
He cowers with his hands over his ears while James looks on. Fred explodes – of course - his top half scattered around the room.
Q: Don’t say it!
BOND: The writing’s on the wall?
Q: Along with the rest of him.
Bond smirks. Never a dull moment.
Q: Now, 007 do try and...
Q is interrupted by a technician being launched across the room by a blast of air.
Nothing interesting to these guys. Bond picks up a sub sandwich and begins to inspect it, looking for knives to shoot from it or something.
Q: Do try and return some of this equipment in pristine order...
Q notices what James is doing.
Q: Don’t touch that!
James is scared as Q grabs the sub.
Q: That’s my lunch!
60 - Ext. Runway - Day
A British Airways jet touches down on the runway in St. Petersburg, Russia.
61 - Ext. Airport Exit - Day
Bond walks from the terminal and spots the guy he’s looking for. Big dude with a stupid fur hat and a trench coat. Name’s Jack Wade, 007’s CIA counterpart. Bond approaches him and ventures at casual conversation, otherwise known as code to establish alliance.
BOND: In London, April’s a spring month.
WADE: Aw yeah? And who are you, the weatherman? And fer cryin’ out loud! Another stiff-ass Brit! Yer secret codes and yer passwords. One of these days you guys’re gonna learn to drop it. Come on, my car’s over there.
Bond is a little annoyed. They cross the street to a little blue...um...car - box thing. Bond opens a door.
BOND: After you.
WADE: Thank you.
James whips out his Walther, jamming it into Wade’s chest.
BOND: Like you said...Drop it!
WADE: Alright, in London April’s a spring month, where’s in St. Petersburg we’re freezin’ our butts off. Now is that close enough for government work?!
BOND: No! Show me the rose.
WADE: Please, no.
Bond slams the gun harder.
WADE: Alright! Alright! Alright!
Wade partially drops his pants showing a tattoo of a rose with the word ‘Muffy’ above it.
BOND: Muffy?
WADE: Third wife. Jack Wade. CIA.
BOND: James Bond. Stiff-ass Brit.
WADE: That’s a nice move...
BOND: Nice car.
WADE: Well, she hasn’t let me down yet. She’s like a little bitch, but she gets ya there. (pause) Hey Bond. Ya do any gardening?
62 - Ext. Train Station - Day
Natalya appears getting off a train, and looks behind her back like she’s being followed. She only sees two Russian soldiers.
63 - Ext. Plaza - Day
The little blue box that Wade calls a car is sitting in the middle of a square with smoke coming from the engine (in the trunk, ya know like old VW Beetles). Wade’s trying to fix it. We move in closer...
WADE: Can ya hand me that wrench, Jimmy?
James picks up a wrench and hands it to Wade.
BOND: So what do you know about Janus?
WADE: Zilch. No one’s ever seen him. But the man’s connected up the gazoo. KGB, military. Screwdriver.
James picks up a screwdriver from the pile of tools.
WADE: Rumor has it, he lives on one of those old Soviet missile trains. That armored stuff they used to run around the country so we couldn’t target’em.
Wade stands up.
WADE: Ya wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo?
Bond picks up a hammer. Wait... “Jimbo”?!
WADE: No, the bigger one. The sledge.
Bond picks up a sledge hammer.
WADE: Anyways, to tell the truth, you don’t find this guy, he finds you.
Wade proceeds to hammer the screwdriver gently into the engine.
WADE: Hell, it’s all Russian Mafia...The best I can do is point you in the direction of his competition.
Wade whacks the engine HARD with the sledge hammer, and roars to life. Bond smirks.
BOND: Who is the competition?
WADE: An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother. Got a limp on his right leg, name’s Zukovsky.
BOND: Valentin Dimitrovich Zukovsky?
WADE: Yeah! You know him?
BOND: I gave him the limp.
64 - Ext. IBM Building - Day
Natalya walks up to a building with the familiar IBM logo on it. She enters.
65 - Int. IBM Building - Day
She walks inside and locates the manager in a room marked ""No Access"" carrying a CPU. She knocks on a door to get the guy’s attention. He puts the CPU down.
MANAGER: Yes?
NATALYA: Are these all you have?
She looks around the room at about 10 to 15 computers.
MANAGER: How many do you want?
She reads from a paper...
NATALYA: Twenty-four for the American school, eleven for the Swedish, IBM Compatible with 500 MHz drives and 34 modems.
MANAGER: You pay dollars?
NATALYA: Of course.
MANAGER: If ma’dam would require a demonstration...
NATALYA: Ma’dam requires a demonstration modem and a quiet place to test it.
The manager shows her into a back room.
66 - Int. Boris’ computer lab - ?
In an unknown location, we see a screen with Boris’ program. “Incoming E-mail”. Boris turns around wearing a sweater with the peace sign on it. Funky. He sees who the mail’s from...
BORIS: Natalya!
Types: “I thought you were dead.”
67 - Int. IBM back room - Day
Natalya is seated at a PC. She types, evidently in an e-mail. “Ourumov killed everyone, fired ‘Petya’, took GoldenEye”. The manager bursts in the room, scaring the crap out of Natalya.
MANAGER: Is everything satisfactory?
NATALYA: Everything except the interruption.
He leaves.
68 - Int. Boris’ computer lab - ?
Boris types: “You aren’t safe. Trust no-one. Meet me at Our Lady of Smolensk in one hour.”
69 - Int. IBM back room - Day
Natalya gets the message, smiles.
70 - Ext. Bridge - Day
The little blue box Wade calls a car drives across a bridge.
WADE (V.O.): Lemme get this straight Jimmy...you shot him in the leg, you stole his car, you took his girl, now you want Valentin Zukovsky to set you up with Janus?
71 - Ext. Valentin’s club - Day
The car pulls up...
BOND (V.O): Yes.
WADE (V.O.): Well, what are ya gonna do, appeal to his heart?
BOND (V.O.): No, his wallet.
WADE (V.O.): Oh, now that might work...OK, showtime!
The car stops and we see Wade and Bond both stuffed inside. They see two Russians by a car.
WADE: Valentin operates out of Building 23, there. You sure you wanna do this? The last guy who dropped in uninvited went home Air Freight. In very small boxes.
BOND: Make sure they send me home First Class.
Bond gets out of the car.
72 - Ext. Church - Day
Natalya walks up to “Our Lady of Smolnesk”, a church.
73 - Int. Church - Day
She walks inside. Quiet. Very quiet. Extremely Romanesque, like in any other large church Orthodox church. Natalya looks up at a suspended cross. She waits, looks for Boris. She spots a suspicious-looking figure in a black cloak, praying. The heavy doors suddenly close by themselves, almost blowing out some candles. Natalya runs, totally freaked out, back down the aisle. The figure looks at her, it’s just an old woman. Around the corner she runs
into Boris, she screams.
BORIS: Natalya! It’s me! It’s Boris, it’s Boris! Hello! Shhh...
Xenia walks up from behind Natalya...
74 - Int. Valentin’s club - Day
Valentin, a big guy with a limp, walks across his nightclub, zips up a woman’s dress. He talks to himself.
VALENTIN: Another morning shot to hell. The free market economy, I swear it will be the end.
Suddenly a gun in cocked by his head. We see it’s Bond’s Walther.
VALENTIN: Walther PPK, 7.65 mm, only three men I know use such a gun...I believe I’ve illed two of them...
We pan to the right. Yep. Bond.
BOND: Lucky me.
Another gun presses against James’ head.
VALENTIN: I think not.
On a stage, a few girls attempt to sing “Stand By Your Man”. Really badly – with Russian accents, to boot! But a few men in the audience stay interested, mainly because of the skimpy costumes. Bond is being ‘escorted’ by two henchmen. They throw him on a couch. Valentin sits on a chair in front of him.
VALENTIN: James Bond. Charming, sophisticated, secret agent. Shaken, but not stirred...
The Russians laugh...
BOND: I see you haven’t lost your delicate sense of humor, Valentin. Or your need for an audience. Who’s strangling the cat?
I couldn’t have put it better myself. Valentin looks quizzically where Bond is gazing.
VALENTIN: Strangling a cat?!
We see the lead singer practically howling ‘Stand by your mahn!!’. Valentin whips out a gun and shoots the couch right between James’ legs...
VALENTIN: It’s Irina. My mistress.
Bond looks like he just swallowed his words.
BOND: Very talented girl...
VALENTIN: Irina!! Take a hike!!!
Irina shuts up right before giving him an “up yours” with her arms.
VALENTIN: So, Mr. Bond; what is it that brings you to my neighborhood? Still working for MI6, or have you decided to join the 21st century? I hear the new M is a lady...
BOND: I want you to do me a favor.
The big Russian laughs.
VALENTIN: He wants me to do HIM a favor!! My knee aches every single day, twice as bad when it is cold. Do you have any idea how long the winter lasts in this country? Tell him Dimitri...
DIMITRI (O.S.): Well, it depends...
VALENTIN: Silence!!!!
BOND: For an ex-KGB agent, you surprise me Valentin. Surely someone of your stature must have realized the skill was not to hit your knee, but to...uh...miss the rest of you.
VALENTIN: So why did you not kill me?
BOND: Call it professional courtesy.
VALENTIN: Then I should extend you the same courtesy...
Valentin shoots to Bond’s right leg, miss. Left leg, miss again. Valentin aims in between...
BOND: Kerov’s Funeral Parlor, 4 o’clock this afternoon!
He’s got his attention...
75 - Int. Valentin’s office - Day
Bond is seated, Valentin’s getting a drink.
BOND: Two hundred pounds of C4 explosives hidden in a casket. Your man drives the hearse in. The money’s  exchanged. Their man drives the hearse out. Their man will be arrested with the explosives. Your man will make a miraculous escape with the money. Your money.
Valentin sits at his desk.
VALENTIN: And what do I owe for this accommodation?
BOND: I want you to set me up. With Janus.
VALENTIN: And what has he done to deserve you?
BOND: Stole a helicopter.
VALENTIN: I have six.
BOND: Three. None that fly.
VALENTIN: Who’s counting?
BOND: These aren’t criminals Valentin, they’re traitors. They used the chopper to steal a nuclear weapon, killed a lot of innocent Russians doing it.
VALENTIN: What do you expect from a Cossack?
BOND: Who?
VALENTIN: This Janus. I’ve never met the man, but I know he’s a Lienz Cossack.
BOND: Grouped that worked for the Nazis against the Russians, second World War.
VALENTIN: You know your history, Mr. Bond. At the end of the war, the Lienz Cossacks surrendered to the British in Austria, believing they would join your government and wage war against the Communists. But the British betrayed them. Sent them back to Stalin who promptly had them all shot. Women, children, families.
BOND: Not exactly our finest hour.
VALENTIN: Still, ruthless people. They got what they deserved.
BOND: I want you to set me up with Janus. Tell him I’m asking about the chopper and
meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel Europe.
VALENTIN: Then you and I are even and he owes me one.
BOND: Precisely.
76 - Ext. Grand Hotel Europe - Night
Bond’s elegant hotel...
77 - Int. Pool Area - Night
A shadow moving through the pool water. James surfaces right in front of the camera, then pushes off the side of the cement pool floating on his back. Nice pool, circular, with huge pillars surrounding it...we see a door open and someone walks in, circling the pool. James is still floating peacefully when he notices someone’s watching him. Wait! Isn’t that...?! He climbs out of the pool. He grabs a towel and dabs his face. Then he grabs his Walther. James pulls the person by the arm, pulling them into a steam room. He aims the gun at...Xenia. Wearing only a loosefitting robe. James is a little interested. His chiseled body is still soaked, hair slicked back...looking sexy...
XENIA:  You don’t need the gun, Commander.
BOND: That depends on your definition of safe sex.
She comes at him, really close. His only weakness...
BOND: That’s close enough.
XENIA:  Not for what I have in mind.
They kiss. James tosses the gun on a massage table. She pulls away, with his lower lip clenched in her teeth. Bond flinches and pushes her to the wall. He touches his lip, a little blood, but enough to get him pissed off. He goes for the gun...Xenia kicks him to the ground before he can get it. She jumps on top of him, he rolls on top of her...
XENIA:  You think you can hurt me?
James gets off of her, and goes for the gun again. Xenia pushes him onto the massage table, and jumps on him. Normally, Bond would love this - but she’s crushing his rib cage. He gasps, and tries to pry her legs off his torso. He gets up, with Xenia still hanging on with her legs, and slams her against the wall.
XENIA:  You think you can break me?
They kiss again wildly...She squeezes harder, Bond’s eyes pop open and he runs slamming Xenia into another wall. Now she’s screaming...he sits her on the steam grate. Another guy has heard the screaming and Bond swiftly knocks him out. He flips Xenia over his shoulder, finally off of him. Now he gets the gun and aims it at her.
BOND: No, no, no. No more foreplay.
He cocks the gun.
BOND: Take me to Janus.
XENIA:  (Russian) Bastard!!
78 - Ext. Statue Junk yard - Night
A gray Mercedes pulls up at a junk yard littered not with garbage, but with hundreds of old stone statues. From before the fall of the Iron Curtain. VERY eerie.
79 - Int. Mercedes - Night
Xenia’s at the wheel, Bond is in back covered in shadow pointing a gun at Xenia.
BOND: This is it?
XENIA:  Yes.
He leans forward, puts the gun away.
BOND: Well, I must say, I’ve had a lovely evening. You?
XENIA:  Once again, the pleasure was all yours.
BOND: You’ll understand if I don’t call...
XENIA:  I won’t loose sleep over it.
He suddenly whacks her in the back of the head, knocking her out.
BOND: Sweet dreams.
80 - Ext. Junk yard - Night
007 steps out of the car, and spots the Tiger helicopter. He draws his gun. This place in very freaky, folks. Plus it’s dark, and Bond’s eyes start to play tricks on him. He aims the gun at someone...no. A statue.
VOICE (O.S.): Hello, James.
Bond whips the gun around at the voice. Sounds familiar...A dark shadow walks out from what’s left of a building. 006 steps into the light. His face is badly scarred on the right side. Bond stands there, frozen in place...
BOND: (Softly) Alec...?
ALEC: Back from the dead. No longer than just an anonymous star on the memorial wall at MI6.
Bond is still frozen, his blue eyes wide.
ALEC: What’s the matter, James? No glib remark? No pithy comeback?
BOND: (Softly) Why...?
Alec laughs.
ALEC: Hilarious question. Particularly from you. Would you ever ask why? Why we toppled all those dictators, undermined all those regimes? Only to come home ‘Well done! Good job, but sorry ol’ boy! Everything you’ve risked your life and limb for has changed!’
BOND: It was the job we were chosen for.
ALEC: Of course you’d say that. James Bond, Her Majesty’s loyal terrier. ‘Defender of the so-called Faith’.
007’s had enough, he raises his gun.
ALEC: Oh, please James. Put it away. It’s insulting to think I haven’t anticipated your every move.
Bond relaxes his arm.
BOND: Yes...I trusted you, Alec.
ALEC: Trust. What a quaint idea.
BOND: How did the MI6 screening miss that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?
ALEC: Once again your faith was misplaced. They knew. We’re both orphans, James. While your parents had the luxury of dying in a climbing accident, mine survived the British betrayal and Stalin’s execution squads. But my father couldn’t let himself or my mother live with the shame of it. MI6 figured I was too young to remember. And one of life’s little ironies, their son goes to work for the government who caused a father to kill himself and his wife.
BOND: Hence, Janus. Two-faced Roman god come to life
ALEC: It wasn’t God who gave me this face...It was you! Setting the timers to three minutes instead of six.
BOND: Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
ALEC: No. You were suppose to die for me. And by the way, I did think of asking you to join my little scheme, but somehow I knew 007’s loyalty was always to the mission, never to his friend. (Pause) Closing time, James. Last call!
Bond goes to raise his gun, but a quick shot is fired. A tranquilizer hits his neck, and Bond collapses. We see a sniper in the background reveal his position. Alec stands over James.
ALEC: For England, James.
81 - Int. Tiger Cockpit - Night
James wakes up and finds himself inside the cockpit of the helicopter. There’s someone behind him...it’s Natalya SCREECHING...
NATALYA (O.S.): WAKE UP!! MISTER! AHHHH! WAKE UP, PLEASE!!! WAKE UP!!!
Bond is totally awake now. Gee.
BOND: I’m here, I’M HERE!!
NATALYA (O.S.): Hurry! Hurry up! Come on! Pull yourself together, or we’re gonna die!
There’s a screen in front of him “Time to Launch”. Bond attempts to free himself, but his hands are tied to tightly.
NATALYA: Do something! You’ve got to get us out of here!!
Bond is still struggling...
BOND: I’m...a little...tied up! Nevermind...
“Time to Launch :19” He tries to hit the controls with his head. The rotor is starting to turn now...”Launch :00” Bond eyes the chopper’s heat-seekers deploy. Oh, crap. Two of them fire and trail back at them. Bond looks for the EJECT button...there it is! He tries to hit it with his head. Once...twice...third time’s a charm! The rotors fly off and the entire cockpit ejects in the nick of time. The helicopter explodes, the parachute discharges, and they land safely on the ground. Bond finally gets the ropes untied, and he hops out of the cockpit.
BOND: The things we do for frequent-flyer mileage...
He opens the canopy for Natalya.
BOND: Here, let me help you...that’s it...mind your head...
He helps her out. She kicks him in the shin. She starts to run away, but 007 grabs arm and tries to calm her down as headlights shine on them. Soldiers pop out of the trucks aiming their weapons. Natalya finally stops struggling.
82 - Ext. Square - Night/early morning
James and Natalya are escorted to a building which could be anything from a jail to a government office.
83 - Int. Interrogation Room - Early morning
James and Natalya walk into a interrogation room handcuffed together. The sun is just starting to come up. Not much in here, just a barren brick room. A guard removes the cuffs and exits, the large metal door slamming behind him. Bond looks to Natalya, who backs away to the wall.
BOND: Who are you?
No answer. He walks toward her.
BOND: Listen, I’m on your side. I’m here to help.
NATALYA: I don’t know anything.
BOND: I don’t believe you.
NATALYA: I don’t care what you believe...
BOND: Look, they might be back for us any minute. You either take your chances with me or your fellow countrymen who killed everyone at Severnaya. Bond is in her face, being a tough guy. Natalya pulls away from him.
NATALYA: I’ve never been to Severnaya.
Bond grabs her arm and looks at her watch.
BOND: Your watch has. Frozen by the GoldenEye blast. And I’m willing to bet you’re the one who climbed out the dish to get out.
NATALYA: Who are you?
BOND: I work for the British government. The more you tell me, the more I can help you.
NATALYA: I said I don’t know anything!!
BOND: Then let’s start with what you do know.
She sits on the table in the middle of the room. She might as well tell him.
NATALYA: My name is Natalya Simonova. I was a systems programmer at the Severnaya facility.
BOND: Go on...
NATALYA: Until they killed everyone.
BOND: Who? Alec Trevelyan?
NATALYA: No. I don’t know who that is.
BOND: Who’s the insider, who’s the traitor?
NATALYA: Boris. Boris Grishenko.
BOND: KGB or military?
NATALYA: Computer programmer.
BOND: There was no one else?
NATALYA: No. They’re going to kill me, aren’t they?
BOND: Trust me.
NATALYA: Trust you. I don’t even know your name.
The door clicks open and the Defense Minister enters, wearing a fedora hat.
MISHKIN: Good morning, Mr. Bond. Sit.
He walks around the table and sits down. James and Natalya do too.
MISHKIN: I’m Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin. By what means shall we execute you Commander Bond?
BOND: What, no small talk? No...chit-chat? That’s the trouble with the world today; no-one takes the time to do a really sinister interrogation anymore. It’s a lost art.
MISHKIN: Your sense of humor doesn’t slay me, Commander, I’m sorry. Where is the GoldenEye.
BOND: I assumed you had it.
MISHKIN: I have an English spy, a Severnaya programmer, a helicopter stolen...
BOND: At least that’s what some traitor in your government wanted it to look like...
MISHKIN: Who was behind your attack on Severnaya...?
BOND: Who had the authorization codes...?
MISHKIN: Russia may have...the penalty for terrorists is death...
BOND: And what’s the penalty for treason...?
NATALYA: Oh, stop it! Both of you! Stop it. You’re like...boys with toys. [Silence.] It was Ourumov. General Ourumov set off the weapon. I saw him do it.
Bond turns his head slowly toward Natalya. Mishkin is pleased.
MISHKIN: Are you certain it was Ourumov?
NATALYA: Yes. He killed everyone and stole the GoldenEye.
MISHKIN: And why would he do that?
NATALYA: There is another satellite.
MISHKIN: Another GoldenEye. Thank you, Miss Simonova. You were saying something about the lost art of interrogation, Mr. Bond?
Ourumov barges in the room, visibly enraged.
OURUMOV:  Defense Minister! I must protest! This’s my investigation! You’re out of order!
MISHKIN: (Russian) Idle praddle. (English) From what I’m hearing, it is YOU who is out of order!
Ourumov picks up the PPK...
OURUMOV:  I’ve seen this gun before...
MISHKIN: Put it down General! Put it down!
OURUMOV:  Do you even know who the enemy is? DO YOU!
MISHKIN: Guards!!
Ourumov quickly shoots a guard as well as Mishkin. Bond hits the deck, pulling Natalya with him. He slides out the clip, takes the bullets, slips the empty clip back into the gun. He thinks aloud...
OURUMOV:  Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin murdered by British agent James Bond.
He tosses the gun to 007.
OURUMOV:  Who was shot while trying to escape...GUARD!
Bond, who’s still on the ground, pushes a chair underneath the General, knocking him over. Then Bond punches him and runs him into a metal pipe. A soldier comes in the room, Bond beats him up and grabs his weapon, then pulls Natalya out the door with him.
BOND: Come on!
84 - Int. Hallway - Morning
Both of them run out the door and up some stairs, Bond shooting soldiers as they run, sliding on the floor, the whole bit. To his right, left, more are coming. They flee through another door.
85 - Int. Archive Hall - Morning
The pair run through a room on the second floor. Shelves full of boxes and old paper occupy the room. More soldiers are coming. Bond pushes a bookcase over, creating a domino effect we’ve seen in cartoons.
OURUMOV:  They’re in the archives!
The falling bookcases barricade a door shut, cutting off Ourumov and company.
OURUMOV:  NO!
They take an alternate route. Bond and Natalya look out a window at a lot filled with trucks and...tanks. They run. Soldiers burst through another door. Natalya is hiding behind a shelf when a few books fall over. The General knows their location now...The Russians are on the first floor, and they hear Bond running above them. The soldiers fire,
Bond fires back, running in front of Natalya. Bond and Natalya stop…
OURUMOV (O.S): Spread out! Cover the other side!
… and he removes the belt Q gave him. He smirks.
BOND: Trust me.
They stand up and run, but Natalya crashes through some loose grating right into Ourumov’s arms. Bond fires the belt. He swings across the room, kicks over a soldier and crashes through a window into the back of a truck.
86 - Ext. Back Lot - Morning
James jumps down from the truck and hides beside a tank.
Bond’s P.O.V. - Natalya being carried off by Ourumov. They get in a car.
OURUMOV:  Go! Now!
It drives away but two more truck-fulls of Russian soldiers enter the lot. Bond eyes a tank. Number 343.
87 - Ext. Streets of St. Petersburg - Morning
Ourumov’s car speeds away, but then a TANK crashes through a solid brick wall. We see Bond poke his head out.
OURUMOV:  Faster!
The tank is close behind the car, cutting turns a little too closely. Ourumov’s car is slowed by traffic.
OURUMOV:  Damn! Go down the alley!
The car peels out through a narrow alley. Tight squeeze...007 notices this too and ducks below. He follows creating a MUCH larger alley. Ourumov takes a swig of his liquor flask. The two jeeps following the tank fly off into the water, exploding.
OURUMOV:  Use the bumper! That’s what it’s for!
So the driver continues, hitting all the bystanders crossing the street. Bond takes a corner, but there are two jeeps in his way. He stops the tank.
SOLDIER: (Russian) Back up!
They do. Bond moves forward. The soldiers fire and 007 ducks below again. A 13-car pile-up clogs the road, but not if you’re in a tank. Bond runs right over it. The tank catches up with the car in a square with a statue in the middle. Both vehicles run over anything in their path: traffic. Bond crashes through a truck with boxes of Perrier on it, and then a statue of a man riding a winged horse. The bronze portion in now riding on top of the tank.
OURUMOV:  Go left!
They do. An archway looks a little low...the statue gets caught in it for a second, hangs there, then drops on two persuing police cars, the statue riding between them. Bond abruptly halts the tank and the cars collide with the backside of the tank. Bond looks back at the damage, coolly straightens his tie and continues. Meanwhile, Ourumov’s car comes screeching to a halt near a black armored train, red star on the side.
OURUMOV:  Get out!
He pulls Natalya out. Xenia jumps down from the train. Ourumov pushes Natalya aboard. Bond is just pulling up, he’s watching now and we can see in his eyes that he’s got an idea... The tank continues. The train lurches forward.
88 - Int. Train - Morning
Inside the train, Ourumov brings Natalya into a car with elegant furnishings. Alec is eating breakfast with an expensive silver tea set. He dabs his mouth with a napkin. Xenia sits behind him.
ALEC: You brought me the perfect gift, General Ourumov. You’ve made me a very unhappy man.
OURUMOV:  Mishkin got to him before I could.
ALEC: Bond is alive?
Ourumov takes out his flask again.
OURUMOV:  He escaped.
ALEC: Good for Bond. Bad for you.
He eyes Natalya and attempts to be a gentleman.
ALEC: Take a seat, my dear.
She does. He walks behind her and kneels down.
ALEC: You know, James and I shared everything. Absolutely everything...
He pulls back her hair from her face.
ALEC: To the victor go the spoils.
89 - Ext. Tracks - Morning
The train travels down the tracks and Bond’s tank pulls up in a tunnel.
90 - Int. Train - Morning
Alec tries to kiss Natalya, she resists.
ALEC: You’ll like it where we’re going...
91 - Ext. Tracks - Morning
Bond’s tank is still sitting there. The driver of the train notices the obstruction.
92 - Int. Train - Morning
Alec kisses Natalya.
ALEC: You may even learn to like me...
He kisses her again, full on the lips this time. She squirms...and slaps him
NATALYA: (Russian) Bastard!
An alarm sounds.
ALEC: (To Ourumov) Stay with her.
Alec and Xenia run to a monitor showing Bond’s tank parked in the tunnel.
ALEC: Bond. Only Bond.
XENIA:  He’s going to derail us...
Alec talks to the conductor with a radio.
ALEC: Full speed!
Conductor: (Russian) What?
ALEC: Full speed!! Ram him!
Xenia’s grinning, the conductor sounds a whistle. Alec and Xenia brace themselves for a collision.
93 - Ext. Tracks - Morning
The train speeds forward toward the tank. Bond fires the main gun, making the train into a speeding fireball. James jumps from the tank crouches in the brush. The train and tank collide, stopping the train in its tracks.
94 - Int. Train - Morning
It looks like an earthquake hit in here. Natalya recovers from the shock and runs for the door. Ourumov grabs her.
Xenia and Alec are still on the floor. Alec comes to and tries to pounce on a gun. A foot pins it to the ground. It’s Bond. Pointing a machine gun at 006. Alec lies on the ground.
ALEC: Why can’t you just be a good boy and die?
BOND: You first. (To Xenia) You, second. UP!
Both stand up.
ALEC: Situation analysis: hopeless. You have no back-up, no escape route. And I have the only bargaining chip.
BOND: Where is she?
ALEC: Ah, yes. Your fatal weakness. (into a radio) Ourumov, bring her in. (to Bond) Lovely girl. Tastes like...strawberries.
BOND: I wouldn’t know...
ALEC: I would.
Xenia is licking her leather-clad fingers. Bond hears Ourumov bring Natalya into the room behind him. With a gun pointed to her head I might add.
ALEC: So, we’re back to where we started, James. The friend or the mission? Drop the gun, I let her live.
BOND: Ourumov, what has this Cossack promised you?
Ourumov is listening...
BOND: You knew, didn’t you? He’s a Lienz Cossack.
ALEC: It’s in the past...
BOND: He’ll betray you! Just like everyone else.
OURUMOV:  Is this true?
ALEC: What’s true is that in 48 hours you and I will have more money than God. And Mr. Bond here will have a small memorial service, with only Moneypenny and a few tearful restitures in attendance. So, what’s the choice, James? Two targets, time enough for only one shot. The girl or the mission?
BOND: Kill her. She means nothing to me.
ALEC: See you in Hell, James.
Bond makes his move. He spins around and shoots Ourumov, then turns and shoots at Alec, but he got away. Armor clicks into place around the doors and windows. Bond runs to every door, and checks the roof.
BOND: One-inch armor plating.
NATALYA: I’m fine, thank you very much.
She sits at a computer. Bond is still fiddling with the roof.
NATALYA: Boris! Yes!
Bond brings his arms down.
Bond:What are you doing?
NATALYA: Boris is online backing up his files. If I can spike him, I may be able to find out where they’re going.
Bond has NO idea what all that means.
BOND: Oh.
NATALYA: Well, don’t just stand there! Get us out of here!
BOND: Yes, sir.
95 - Ext. Train - Morning
The top of the train retracts to reveal a little Robinson helicopter.
96 - Int. Train - Morning
Bond is pulling up carpet, trying to find a place to cut through.
97 - Int. Robinson - Morning
Alec and Xenia are seated in the chopper.
98 - Int. Train - Morning
We see the screen with Boris’ program. An intercom sounds.
ALEC (V.O.): Good luck with the floor, James. I set the timers for six minutes. The same six minutes you gave me.
99 - Int. Robinson - Morning
ALEC: It was the least I could do for a friend.
He laughs, really sinister folks...
100 - Int. Train - Morning
NATALYA: What does that mean?
BOND: We’ve got three minutes.
He takes off his watch.
101 - Ext. Train - Morning
The little chopper flies away.
102 - Int. Boris’ Unknown Location - Who knows???
Boris is seated at a computer, twirling a pen around his fingers.
103 - Int. Train - Morning
Natalya is sending a SPIKE. “Spike Sent”
104 - Int. Boris’ Location - ?????
Boris notices the problem, and he freezes.
105 - Int. Train - Morning
Bond is burning through the floor with the laser from his watch. Natalya is trying to figure out Boris’ password... “butt’...no. “Arse”...no. “Buns”...no. “Rear”...no!
NATALYA: What else do you call your butt?
BOND: What?!
NATALYA: It’s Boris’ password, he plays word games. It’s what I sit on, but I can’t take it with me...
BOND: Chair.
NATALYA: Like I said...
She tries it...BINGO! “Starting Search”
BOND (O.S.): Thirty seconds...
A map pops up. A red line etches cities together.
NATALYA (O.S.): He’s not in Russia, Germany, Paris, London, Madrid...
BOND (O.S.): Twenty-five seconds...
NATALYA (O.S.): New York, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco...
BOND: Twenty seconds...!
Bond jumps on the floor, trying to break it.
NATALYA: Mexico City, Rio, Miami...
106 - Int. Boris’ Location - ????
Boris opens a large CPU and rips the circuit boards out, in an attempt to cut the tracer.
107 - Int. Train - Morning
Bond finally kicked the floor in. He grabs her arm.
BOND: Come on!
NATALYA: Wait! He’s in Cuba! Havana, no...
“Disconnected Search Program”
BOND: NOW!
He pulls her away and they both jump down the hole in the floor.
108 - Ext. Train - Morning
They roll out from under the train and sprint away from the ticking bomb. The train explodes and they fall to the ground. They sit up and watch the burning train. Natalya turns to Bond.
NATALYA: Do you destroy every vehicle you get into?
BOND: Standard operating procedure. Boys with toys!
NATALYA: Hmmm. Maybe I should take care of our transportation for our trip to Cuba.
Bond puts his watch back on. Wait...
BOND: Our trip...?
NATALYA: You know how to disarm the weapon?
BOND: Well, I suppose that depends on what kind of weapon you’re talking about disarming...
She smiles and moves in closer...
NATALYA: Tell me, are there any other standard operating procedures I should be aware of, Commander?
BOND: Thousands...but I only pay them...
They kiss.
BOND: Lip service.
They kiss again. We fade into...
109 - Ext. Tropical Road - Day
A beautiful beach. Obviously somewhere in the Carribean. Some island near Cuba. Palm trees and all. Sweet! We pan over to the right, as the blue BMW convertible vvrooms down a dirt road. Bond’s driving...nice sunglasses...Natalya is in a flowered dress. She grins. He grins back.
NATALYA: My whole life I’ve dreamed of coming to the Carribean. It’s so beautiful. Not another human being in sight.
An alarm sounds in the car. A blue screen - a GPS tracking system - pops up. There’s something behind them...Natalya looks up. A Cessna touches down on the road, right in front of the BMW.
NATALYA: What is it with you and moving vehicles?!!
The plane stops, and the BMW screeches to a halt. Wade hops out with a loud Hawaiian shirt on. He’s holding a bag. Bond and Natalya get out of the car.
WADE: Yo! Jimbo! Brought a little gift from ol’ whats-his-name - T? Z?
BOND: Q.
Bond looks in the bag.
BOND: What are you doing here, Wade?
Wade is looking at some of the trees.
WADE: Banion trees... Why, I’m not here. The CIA has no knowledge, no involvement. Absolutely nothin’ to do with your insertion into Cuba, if ya catch my drift.
Bond slips his shades into his shirt pocket.
BOND: Yes I do, perfectly.
WADE: Borrowed the plane from a friend o’ mine in the DEA. Now the Coast Guard and the FAA are both in the loop. You’re cleared on our radar til 06.00 hours.
Wade picks up a piece of paper in the plane.
WADE: Here’s the latest SAT CAM from Langley. Stay below 600 feet.
Natalya studies the paper.
NATALYA: Five hundred feet.
WADE: Who’s that?
BOND: Natalya Simonova.
He pronounces it wrong.
NATALYA: Natalya Simonova.
BOND: Russian Minister of Transportation.
Wade signals with his staw hat for Bond to talk with him ‘privately’. They move a few inches.
WADE: Did you check her out?
Bond gets that look in his eye...
BOND: Head-to-toe.
Wade grins.
WADE: Right...So yer lookin’ fer a dish the size of a football field, huh? Doesn’t exist. Ya can’t light a cigar in Cuba without us seein’ it!
NATALYA: I know it’s there. It’s a duplicate of Severnaya, like you secret transmitters in New Zealand.
WADE: I’ve never been to New Zealand. (to Bond) How’s she know ‘bout that?!
BOND: What if I need back-up?
WADE: Get on the radio. I’ll send in the Marines! Anyway hang a left at the end of the runway, Cuba’s seven miles on yer right.
Wade walks up to the BMW.
BOND: Yo, Wade.
Bond tosses the keys to Wade. He catches them in his hat.
BOND: Just one thing...
Wade hops in.
WADE: Yeah?
BOND: Don’t push any of the buttons on that car.
WADE: I’m just gonna go bombin’ around in it!
BOND: Exactly.
WADE: Yo James. I got faith. But be careful. He knows yer comin’.
Wade speeds away. Bond and Natalya are left with the plane.
110 - Ext. Beach - Evening
James is sitting on a beach outside their beach-house, deep in thought. Natalya approaches him wearing a white bikini. For once, our 007 doesn’t seem to care... Somethin’s wrong. She sits beside him.
NATALYA: He was your friend...Trevelyan?
James glances at her. No answer.
NATALYA: And now he’s your enemy and you will kill him. It is that simple.
BOND: In a word...yes.
NATALYA: Unless he kills you first.
BOND: Natalya...
NATALYA: You think I’m impressed?! All of you! Your guns, your killing, your death...for what?! So you can be a hero? All the heroes I know are dead.
BOND: Natalya, listen to me...
NATALYA: How can you act like this? How can you be so cold?
BOND: It’s what keeps me alive.
NATALYA: No. It’s what keeps you alone.
She starts to get up but he pulls her back down to a kiss. She pulls away, but then kisses him, harder. We fade up on...
111 - Int. Bedroom - Night
A fire burns brightly as we fade up. It’s the bedroom of the place they’re staying. We pan to the right and reveal James sleeping peacefully on the bed. Shirt off. Probably more, but we can’t see. A voice...
NATALYA (O.S.): James?
His blue eyes open. Barely above a whisper...
BOND: Yes?
Natalya appears from beside him on the bed, wrapped among the sheets. She rolls on top of him.
NATALYA: On the train, when you told them to kill me - and that I meant nothing to
you...did you mean it?
They stroke each other’s hair. He smiles...slowly.
BOND: Yes.
Natalya looks at him weird...
BOND: Basic rule. Always call their bluff.
Natalya takes a pillow and playfully smothers him with it. Bond’s laughing...they grin and kiss again passionately.
112 - Ext. Cuban sky - Day
The little plane soars over blue water and up a cliff with dense vegetation.
113 - Int. Plane - Day
James and Natalya, both dressed in camouflage green, sit in the cockpit. Natalya has a flight map in front of her, and is telling James where to fly.
NATALYA: Turn ten degrees south, bearing 184.
BOND: Yes, sir.
She laughs. They fly over a crystal blue lake.
NATALYA: Nothing. There is nothing here.
BOND: Let’s make another pass.
They do. Bond looks out.
BOND: Maybe Wade was right, maybe there is no dish.
A ground-to-air missile fires from the water and hits the wing of the Cessna. They’re going down...Bond tries to land in the water, a little off...they’re gonna crash into forest! He pulls both their heads down below the windshield, brace yourselves, folks...make sure your seats and tray-tables are in the upright and locked position...the little plane skids off the surface of the lake and hits the trees, breaking what’s left of the wings off. It finally slows to a halt.
114 - Ext. Rainforest - Day
We see Bond’s arm poke out of the broken windshield. They’re alive, a bit shaken...not stirred -- sorry, I had to! Natalya appears to be knocked out. Bond kicks the door open. He carries her -- well, more accurately, he drags her -- out into the open. Yep, she’s quite unconscious. He drops her to the ground and collapses on top of her.
BOND: Natalya...?
No answer. Duh. He rolls off her, lays on his back and passes out. Time passes, we fade up on Bond’s closed eyes. Then they open, groggily, to see a superimposed Scorpion helicopter. A rope drops from the chopper. Bond attempts to get up, still dazed. We see a person slide down the rope. Bond’s on his feet, still out of it, he stares up at the person. It’s Xenia, who else? Xenia’s P.O.V. - Knocks Bond to the ground.
She kicks him again, then pulls him by the collar.
XENIA:  This time, Mr. Bond, the pleasure will be all mine.
She licks his face as she crushes his ribs again. Bond struggles, in pain. Natalya has woken up...She tries to whack Xenia with a big stick, but Xenia’s too quick. She knocks it to the ground, and grabs Natalya by the face.
XENIA:  Wait for your turn!
She bangs Natalya with her forehead, knocking her out. Bond has recovered, and he clips the rope to Xenia’s harness and uses her machine gun to shoot down the chopper pilot.The helicopter goes down, yanking the rope, and Xenia, along with it. She is pulled through the air, screaming, and slammed against a tree. She struggles for a few seconds, but falls silent. The chopper explodes in a bright flash, and our heroes duck to the ground. Bond looks at Xenia, dangling from the tree.
BOND: She always did enjoy a good squeeze.
115 - Int. Control deck - Day
We cut to inside a large control room, its location still unknown. Trevelyan walks down the stairs, dressed in black. He walks through a glass door to where Boris is sitting at a station of computers.
ALEC: Is the satellite in range?
BORIS: Six minutes.
ALEC: Prepare the dish.
BORIS: No it is too early! I am not ready.
ALEC: Do it!!
Alec walks away. Fine. If he wants it now, he’ll get it now.
116 - Ext. Rainforest - Day
Bond and Natalya push on through a dense jungle. They see a large satellite dish rising from the water. Like the one in Severnaya.
BOND: No wonder we couldn’t see it.
The dish is still rising.
BOND: Come on.
We cut to a full view of the dish, then we see James and Natalya running toward it.
117 - Int. Control deck - Day
Alec opens the protective case and pulls the GoldenEye out. He faces Boris.
ALEC: The world’s greatest cash card.
Trevelyan hands it to an eager Boris, but doesn’t take his hands off the GoldenEye.
ALEC: It had better not be rejected.
Boris grabs it and slips it into the slot.
118 - Ext. Dish - Day
The lake water drains now and reveals the “dish” part of the satellite. Bond glances at Natalya.
119 - Ext. Outer space
We see the GoldenEye satellite in orbit.
120 - Ext. Rainforest - Day
Bond walks closer to the camera, watching...the water keeps draining.
121 - Ext. Road - Day
Bond and Natalya run along a road, closer to the dish.
122 - Int. Control deck - Day
Boris is playing with a pen. He glances at a monitor.
BORIS: Mischa is online.
A soldier approaches Alec and hands him a hand-held video screen. Alec looks at it. We see live footage of Bond and Natalya climbing down closer to the dish.
SOLDIER: Sir!
ALEC: Kill him. The man just won’t take a hint...
BORIS: Target coordinates...?
ALEC: Target is London.
123 - Int. Engine room - Day
Gears grind inside an engine room, moving the antenna into position.
124 - Ext. Dish - Day
Bond and Natalya notice the movement.
NATALYA: He’s getting ready to signal the satellite.
BOND: How do you stop it?
NATALYA: The transmitter above the anten...
She is interrupted by shots fired at them. They duck, then dive into the dish. Trevelyan’s soldiers are still firing at them as they slide faster and faster down into the bottom of the dish. We notice there’s a drop in the center where all the water must have drained into. Bond stops himself, bracing his feet at the ledge of the drop, then catches Natalya.
He looks into the hole. We see a circular door in the bottom.
125 - Int. Control deck - Day
Boris is still seated at the computers.
BORIS: Antenna in position.
Alec hands Boris one of the two operational keys. They slip them into their slots.
ALEC: On my count...3...2...1!
They turn them at the same time. The same map we saw in Severnaya appears on the wall-size screen. A line moves to intercept London.
126 - Outer space
Mischa moves into orbit.
127 - Int. Control deck - Day
Alec twists a red dial. “Weapon Armed”
ALEC: God save the Queen.
128 - Int. Facility - Day
Bond and Natalya climb down a ladder below the dish into the facility. Every soldier is on alert. The good guys move around stealthily as the soldiers shout out things in Spanish. Natalya spots a console to the mainframe.
NATALYA: The mainframe computer.
BOND: Don’t move!
He takes off. James shoots two guards with the Walther, and hides behind a pillar. He notices Natalya climbing down a ladder to the mainframe, despite his orders.  007 fires at the soldiers again. He takes out two detonators and arms them. Soldiers get into better positions, aim at Bond. James realizes he’s outnumbered drastically. He slides the PPK across the floor and shows himself with his arms raised. A soldier shoves him against a wall, pats him down, looking for more weapons. Another soldier grabs him by the collar of his combat vest. We pan to the left showing...the detonators planted on a pouring tank of a pinkish, probably flammable liquid. Meanwhile, the soldiers are bringing Bond down the stairs to the control deck. We see Natalya poke her head out from behind a tank. She runs back into...
129 - Int. Mainframe - Day
Inside a room that houses a terminal for the mainframe computer, Natalya sits down and begins to type...
130 - Int. Control deck - Day
The soldiers escort Bond to where Alec is standing near Boris. His former friend notices 007.
ALEC: James! What an unpleasant surprise.
BOND: We aim to please.
ALEC: Where’s the girl?
No answer from Bond. Like we expected one... Alec turns to his henchmen.
ALEC: Find her!!
A few soldiers hurry to find her. On the table are the things that were found in Bond’s pockets; the Walther, a pen (Q’s pen...), and Bond’s passport. Alec fingers through them. He picks up the pen.
ALEC: So how is ol’ Q? Up to his usual tricks? The watch.
Bond sheds his watch. Alec compares it to his own. Slightly different.
ALEC: Ah. New model. Still press here, do I?
He presses a button, we cut to see the detonators disarm. The pink liquid is really starting to flood now...
131 - Int. Mainframe - Day
Natalya is still typing at the computer terminal.
132 - Int. Control deck - Day
We see a screen. Looks similar to PC Banking. LOADS of cash. Bond knows what’s going on...
BOND: Interesting set-up, Alec. You break into the Bank of England via computer and transfer the money electronically. Just seconds before you set off the GoldenEye, which erases any record of the transactions. Ingenious.
ALEC: Thank you, James.
BOND: But it still boils down to petty theft. In the end you’re just a bank robber. Nothing more than a common thief.
Well, that pisses Alec off. He stands up, very annoyed. Bond just has a special way of getting people mad at him...
133 - Int. Mainframe - Day
The soldiers have located Natalya in the mainframe. She’s almost done... They grab her, but she manages to click ‘ENTER’. “Encryption in Progress”. Ouch.
134 - Int. Control deck - Day
ALEC: You always did have a small mind, James. It’s not just erasing bank records, it’s everything on every computer in Greater London. Tax records. Stock market. Credit ratings. Land registries. Criminal records. In sixteen minutes and 43...42 seconds the United Kingdom will re-enter the Stone Age.
As he speaks, he circles Bond.
BOND: A world-wide financial meltdown. And all so mad little Alec can settle a score with the world, 50 years old.
ALEC: Oh, please James. Spare me the Froud. I might as well ask for all those vodka martinis that’ll silence the screams of all the men you’ve killed.
Natalya is brought into the room now. Alec glances at her.
ALEC: Or if you’ll find forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women. For all the dead ones you’ve failed to protect. England is about to learn the cost of betrayal. Inflation adjusted from 1945.
He turns to Natalya.
ALEC: Welcome to the party, my dear.
Boris finally looks up to see who has just ‘joined the party’.
BORIS: Natalya!!
Natalya lunges at him and punches him in the face, he falls to the ground, cowering under the desk as Natalya continues to beat him up. Soldiers finally pull her away. Alec smirks. Boris puts his glasses back on, and picks up the grenade pen. He’s still on the floor, twirling it pen nervously. He gets up, visibly mad, and Boris faces Natalya.
BORIS: Don’t ever do that again!!
NATALYA: This is not one of your games, Boris. Real people will die! You pathetic little worm.
Boris goes to hit her, but Alec grabs his arm.
ALEC: She was in the mainframe! Check the computer!
Boris yanks his arm free from Alec’s grasp.
BORIS: She’s a moron. A second level programmer. She works on the guidance systems.
Natalya looks as if she’d spit in Boris’ face.
BORIS: She doesn’t even have access to the firing codes.
He spoke too soon. An alarm sounds. Boris runs to a computer. Natalya smirks.
BORIS: Retro-Rockets firing!
135 - Space
Rockets fire from the satellite, moving it into the atmosphere.
136 - Int. Control deck - Day
Boris types away, twirling the pen with his right hand, clicking it a few times here and there. Bond watches the pen very attentively.
ALEC: What the hell’s happening?!
BORIS: We’ll have re-entry in...12 minutes!
“Mission Aborted”
NATALYA: It’ll burn up somewhere over the Atlantic.
ALEC: Deal with it!
BORIS: She changed the access codes!
ALEC: Then she can fix it...!!
Alec takes out a pistol and shoves it in Bond’s jaw.
NATALYA: Go ahead, shoot him. He means nothing to me.
Bond rolls his blue eyes.
BORIS: I can do it! I can break her codes!
ALEC: Then get on with it!!
Boris types, twirls the pen. Clicks it two times...looking for three times... Bond watches...Boris drops the pen...Alec is fed up...he points the gun at Natalya.
ALEC: Tell him! Now!
Boris stands up enraged. We hear the pen click three times. Bingo. Four seconds...
BORIS: Give me the codes, Natalya! Give them to me!!
Bond knocks the pen from Boris, Bond and Natalya duck. The pen lands in the leaking pink liquid. KA-BOOM!! Huge explosion. Bond and Natalya break for the elevator.
137 - Int. Elevator - Day
BOND: Can Boris break your codes?
NATALYA: Possibly.
BOND: Possibly?! We have to destroy the transmitter.
NATALYA: By the way, I’m fine, thank you very much.
138 - Int. Control deck - Day
That pink stuff was flammable. People are on fire, equipment is exploding.
139 - Ext. Elevator - Day
The elevator stops at a tower near the antenna. A guard watches the doors open...revealing Natalya laying on the floor, her back to us. Where’s Bond? The guard approaches her and...Bond drops down from the ceiling of the elevator. He slams the guard into the metal walls. Bond hands Natalya the guard’s pistol.
BOND: Do you know how to use one of these?
Natalya slides the mag out, replaces the mag, cocks it. A real pro, folks!
NATALYA: Yes.
BOND: Good. Stand aside.
Bond runs across a metal bridge leading to the antenna.
141 - Int. Control deck - Day
Whoever’s not dead is controlling the fire with extinguishers now. Alec walks up to Boris.
ALEC: How long?
BORIS: Two minutes...one minute!
Alec yells to some soldiers.
ALEC: Guard!
BORIS: I’m fixing it!
A soldier steps to Alec’s side.
ALEC: If he moves, kill him.
The soldier points a pistol at Boris’ head.
142 - Ext. Dish - Day
Natalya spots a helicopter...
143 - Ext. Antenna - Day
Alec runs to a cable car thing leading to the antenna.
144 - Int. Control deck - Day
Boris wipes the sweat from his glasses, typing in concentration.
145 - Space
The satellite begins to enter the atmosphere, turning red-hot with friction.
146 - Ext. Bridge - Day
Bond sprints up the narrow bridge, Alec is close behind him on the cable car. Alec fires an assault rifle at 007. Bond hits the deck, fires his own automatic. Alec runs out of ammo, so does Bond. Alec re-loads, Bond ditches the gun and runs up the bridge.
147 - Int. Control deck - Day
Boris is still typing...
148 - Ext. Bridge - Day
Alec finally takes a handgun and fires at the running 007, but misses him. Alec gets off the car and runs after Bond. He shoots again, Bond flies forward doing a mid-air somersault down an incline and continues. Alec re-loads.
149 - Int. Engine room - Day
Bond hops down into the engine room for the transmitter.
150 - Int. Control deck - Day
“Send Command”. Boris cracked the code.
BORIS: YES! I am invincible!!
He types away.
151 - Int. Engine room - Day
The gears start to move again. Alec finds Bond. They fight, evenly matched. Bond throws 006 down the stairs and shoots a pistol at him. Just misses. But he has an idea of how to stop the antenna; the old fashioned way! Bond grabs a metal pole off the wall and shoves it in the gear belt. He runs down the stairs after Alec. We see the pole do its work. It’s now stuck between two gears.
152 - Int. Control deck - Day
“Antenna Malfunction”. Boris squeaks.
153 - Ext. Dish - Day
The antenna screeches to a halt. Bond notices some blood on a railing. Still fresh. He hears a clang of metal-on-metal. Aims at the sound. Nothing. He jumps down into...
154 - Int. Another room - Day
This room looks like it houses the electricity. Bond points the gun around, looking for Alec. Behind him Alec swings down through the door and kicks 007 in the face. They fight again, 006 appears to be winning. Both seem to know the other one’s next move. Both drop their guns, hand-to-hand now. Slamming each other against walls, punch, kick. James starts to get ahead of things, and blocks Alec’s hits. He slams him into a wall, Bond goes for a gun...Alec kicks it away, it fires at nothing. They push each other over tables, block each other’s hits. Whoa, both really know how their opponent fights. Alec gets the chance to grab a gun. He aims it at Bond who’s clings to a ladder, panting. ALEC: You know, James. I was always better.
James kicks a lever just before Alec fires. The ladder he’s hanging on to drops down into the sun, very high above the dish. Bond hangs on for dear life...groaning as the ladder jerks to a stop.
155 - Ext. Rainforest - Day
Natalya sees Bond on the ladder in obvious trouble.
156 - Ext. Ladder - Day
Alec has run out of bullets. He takes out a radio, calls for the helicopter.
ALEC: Alpha one to Gunship!
157 - Ext. Rainforest - Day
The helicopter pilot gets in the chopper.
Alec (V.O.): Alpha one to Gunship!!
158 - Ext. Ladder - Day
Bond starts to climb up the ladder, Alec starts to climb down.
159 - Int. Engine room - Day
The gears and things are catching on fire...
160 - Ext. Ladder - Day
Alec decides to slide down the ladder, definitely quicker. He hits Bond with his feet, who slips but just grabs on to the last rung. By one arm.
161 - Ext. Rainforest - Day
The chopper takes off.
162 - Ext. Ladder - Day
Bond looks down. Whoa...WAY too far to jump. And live. No way! Alec, the epitamy of evil, places his boot on Bond’s knuckles. And stomps on it. James has no choice but to let go...and lands on part of the antenna. Only about six feet in diameter. Held up by wires. He can barely pull himself up.
168 - Space
The satellite’s burning up now, in re-entry.
169 - Int. Control deck - Day
Boris is frantically shaking the monitor.
BORIS: SPEAK TO ME!!
170 - Ext. Ladder - Day
Alec jumps down to where Bond is and grabs him by the throat, holding him over the side. The helicopter flies into view. Alec looks at it for a spit second...
171 - Int. Helicopter cockpit - Day
Natalya appears in the chopper and presses a gun in the pilot’s temple.
172 - Ext. Ladder - Day
Bond uses this window of opportunity. He kicks 006 off of him and flips him over the side. At the last second he grabs Alec’s foot. Do it in style, James...
ALEC: For England, James?
Bond’s icy eyes are that of a ruthless killer, now.
BOND: No. For me.
And with that he drops his ex-friend/neo-enemy. Alec hits the bottom of the disk with a sickening THUD.
173 - Int. Control deck - Day
Boris is SCREAMING at the top of his lungs, horror movie style.
174 - Space
The satellite explodes in the Earth’s atmosphere.
175 - Ext. Dish - Day
Alec moves his head a little. Natalya forces the helicopter pilot to fly closer to 007.
176 - Int. Engine room - Day
...on fire.
177 - Ext. Ladder - Day
Bond leaps and grabs hold of the chopper’s runners. They fly clear of the whole facility, the antenna’s gonna blow any minute...KA-BOOM! As the whole damn thing blows up and falls right on top of screaming Alec.
178 - Int. Control deck - Day
Boris pokes his head out of the rubble. In pieces, but he’s still alive. He jumps up triumphantly.
BORIS: I am invincible!!!
Spoke too soon, pal. Just as he says that the liquid nitrogen tanks explode, freezing him into place.
179 - Ext. Field - Day
The chopper lets Bond fall to the ground in a clearing. Natalya jumps out, and it flies away. She drops on top of him. He flinches in pain. She’s worried, and stokes his black hair from his forehead.
NATALYA: James! James! Are you all right?!
Bond recovers. Flashes a grin. Likes the position she put him in...
BOND: Yes, I’m fine. Thank you.
They kiss, happy to be alive. They roll over so Bond’s on top. Natalya grins.
NATALYA: Suppose someone is watching....
He continues to kiss her. They’re in the middle of nowhere, for god’s sake.
BOND: There’s no one in twenty-five miles, believe me.
They kiss again. We hear a familiar voice...
WADE (O.S.): Yo! Jimbo!!
There he goes with the ‘Jimbo’ again...James is really startled, he flips suddenly to his knees as soon as he hears that Southern accent. God, it’s Wade. In camo.
BOND: Is this supposed to be your idea of...um...coming through in a clinch?!
WADE: It’s the back-up plan. Hey, I’d said I’d be here, huh? Yo! Marines!
Wade gives the USMC sign to reveal your position. About thirty-five Marines appear from nowhere, rising from the grass. Helicopters land around. What’s that...Bond’s blushing a little!
WADE: Maybe you two would like to finish de-briefing each other at Guantanamo?
Bond looks at Natalya.
BOND: You ready?
NATALYA: I’m not going on that helicopter with you...
Bond flashes her a quizzical look.
BOND: Hmmm?
NATALYA: No plane! No train! Nothing that moves!
He picks her up. She’s still giggling. He gives us that grin again.
BOND: Darling, what could possibly go wrong, eh?
The helicopters load up and fly out. Fade up on the credits, complete with “JAMES BOND WILL RETURN”.Embed",metal

See back then, the goal was musical buzz
""What? You're saying you're above battle rap?""
No, you dumb motherfuckers, I never said that
I just had to pursue what I love
If that's something you view as a snub, that's a you problem
These rounds, Diz you really got a Jew problem
Megaton better come with a new nuke on 'em
Throat sores, so I'm goin' Michael Jordan with the flu on 'em
Am I better than this? No
But I'm better than you
Not as a battler, listen, I'ma say this
Not necessarily not as a battler, but as a person, that's what the evidence proves
When I present it to you
You might pretend it's a ruse
And I intend to confuse
You know what they say about those treacherous Jews
I have a question for you
Saw you vs Iron
Shit's brilliant
But now that this Jew got next, tell me
How many Jew jokes have you got left?
Hold on, let me guess; six million?
But let me get back, to reflectin' and building on all that it happened
Since I left the field like I was Dr. Manhattan
I was living off of my rapping
'till I tied the knot, then I got into a tighter spot
Then I had to find a job
But
Wait, sorry fuck
So Diz', a job is a place where you go to make money
Like an office or store
You ever seen The Office before?
It's like that, but less funny
And then you get a check
You can spend it on your food and ya rent
Fuck, I'm doing it again
So Diz', rent...
I'll take it slow
See rent is this thing where you know find a place, and you pay money to stay monthly
See, I ain't know if you're aware of it, because you ain't left your parents till your fuckin' late 20s
So according to you, right, on Twitter you called me a ""manchild""
The audacity!
That you, mister level headed adult
YOU called me a ""manchild"" that is damn wild
You were living with your mom and dad while
I was in my own crib, diggin' up dirt on QP for that damn file
Back to that Iron battle, you know I gotta say
The angle about Jews not going to work on 9/11, kinda clever
Except you didn't go to work on 9-- ever
See down the line I went through shit
My crew split
As too did my creative drive, my will to stay alive took a huge dip
And my momma got too sick
Down to a toothpick
And I stopped makin' music
See the sad thing is Diz, you said I tried and I flopped
Nah, it was going fine, then I stopped
It was painful, truly
See, I know it sounds sad, but Soul is still a Joker though
I ain't talking about the Gotham kind
Talking like Persona 5
That is what I was personified
Cause I lost track of all the kind of monsters I had caught inside
Especially the one whisperin' to me that I oughta die
So bottom line, there is nothing you can say to me
That is more evil than the shit I used to tell myself all the time
I got out that coma I been frozen lately
I gotta thanks all the homies that could motivate me
Even though the road was shaky
Like the way Dizaster's parents thought it was okay to hold a baby
So now y'all here to see my return to the format
You here to be my personal doormat
Hold up
Before we go all that
Do battle rappers still say dumb shit like ""you catch a shell, then you sleep like Squirtle and Snorlax""?
No, good
Well ignore that, fantastic
You know, I respect you Diz, because you're willing to give someone the shirt off your back
Even when they didn't need it, or were asking you for that
He takes his shirt off all the time
And I know you like to make fun of the way I make apologies
Lot of liberals are faker than astrology
I'm not a liberal, I'm a leftist, and the difference is tremendous
And there's one thing I have to say, it's gotta be legit
I am sorry, for every bomb that Israel has ever launched at Lebanon
They always got a reason and each of them is fucking extra wrong
The IDF level houses, you know, bring fiery death on thousands
Maybe someone you knew
Nah I ain't pushing no button, but, Israeli government always said they do it in the name of the Jews
This ain't a angle or a gimmick, fuck the haters and the cynics
But I refuse to accept that any Jew is protected by doing something so fuckin' hateful to you
On top of all that
And all the while, the West Bank has gotten terrorized
Every day in Gaza's genocide
And America could end it by threatening to ends its ties
But they just always defend it
And the Palestinians get left to die
At this point, Diz probably thinkin'
This ain't therapy
Diz, that ain't fair to me
Because I gotta grapple in my disgrace
And my old battles are like your face, they've aged terribly
And to everybody, to all you who suggested; ""No SJW stuff""
I've reviewed your request, and, shut the fuck up!
I know they hate it when I do this, but sorry, I'm accountable
So, I am sorry if I have hurt anyone who was marginalized with the words that I'd use
Especially cause it doesn't reflect my personal views
I fucked up so much
And that's being accountable
Being a fuckin' shithead is not a fuckin' alpha move
And it's like fuckin', and I'm not talkin' about like some light politeness like not talking when ya mouth is full
You might also like[Dizaster] I'm the only one reacting

[Soul Khan]
And that's why it's the best line
See what you refer to as political correctness is just giving some respect for a minute or a second, it's forethought
And if you dismiss and reject it
Cause you think it's makes you different or you're edgy
You're not
So, what to do?
Diz, what are your preferred gender pronouns?
Usually say like he, him, his, whatever
So mine are he, him, his
Look at how easy that it is
It only takes fuckin' two seconds
But all these anti PC motherfuckers will complain for hours about it
And how PC it is
So let me make the math
There are more than two genders, your eyebrows look like two sweaters
Disgustingly huge pairs, fuck tweezers, use Nair
I bet the effort it takes to groom is tremendous
If you have one square up there, you'd win at Tetris
I mean this in the kindest way
So what happened?
Everything that happened after Math, I have to ask
Should I be scared of you?
Or do you only attack me if I dare you to?
Diz, Diz, c'mon man, are you, wait a second
Am I getting this right
Will you do anything to anybody dares you to?
Are you sure?
Challenge accepted
Too bad
Consent negative, my bad
Alright so, JK, you can't be that, don't do that, always say that
Anyway so, challenge accepted
Diz...I dare you to kiss me
I mean my man
I ain't pausin' shit, I ain't pausin' shit
In 2019, we past pausin'
Hold up, hold up
Can anyone else do this shit
It ain't scary or risky
Go back to the hotel, share some whisky
My girl's okay with it
C'mon tough guy, you gon' kiss me or not?
C'mon! No!
You gon' kiss me
Hold on, this the important part
C'mon tough guy, you gon' kiss me or not?
Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Iz, King of the Dot!
[Dizaster]
This was his plan to defuse all my shit. Is it my turn?

[Soul Khan]
So, no, no man. This is a long round. I'm doing a long round for you! It's for you!

I dare you
I dare to not rap forever and render this unwatchable
I dare you to fight our friend Math and not end up in the hospital
I can't fly all the way to see it
In any case, I dare you to make a song that isn't absolute garbage
So you could be an actual artist
Instead of pretending to be the rapper you aren't
But...also sir, I gotta say, those braids
They are ridiculous dude
If you hate the culture vultures, you officially lose
You look like a white girl gettin' her groove on a Caribbean cruise
But
Hold on
Diz, is this some sort of style of hair of Arabs I'm unaware of?
I mean this shit is you? No, this shit is new
I remember the old days, when your hair used to be
You would see
In a park full of skaters
So many spikes it was like your barber was playing a game of Mario Maker
If you wanna use Sega
Your coif is a mess dawg
Out there looking like Islamic the Hedgehog
Wait a second though, I'm sensitive to this shit
Is that offensive to y'all, or the, you watching at home
Cause I felt it was like borderline
Sorta like when Madness called me Jew-Pac Shalom
Which is funny-
Diz, my friend is
Is it offensive to you Diz?
Might be a reason to pretend that it is
We both know a secret
You oughta know
Let me take you back
I recently remembered
When you and I were at Club Excess
In a pit like this
Doin' shit like this
And
Diz was saying, this and that, I wasn't listening
You know what Diz is like?
It's a thing
Thing, the moment that burned in my memory
Is when he turned and he said to me
Yo bro, it's funny, I ain't exactly Muslim shit
And I was like, what? good lord!
Diz, are you telling us?
That through your entire battling career, and you've been battling for years, a third of your life, earning your stripes
You led us to believe that you're Muslim, and this whole motherfucking time
You never actually said one
You not exactly, I never was gonna say that
See he says, I never said I was a Muslim
But you say it in the battles, not the interviews
But every time the interviewer calls you Muslim, you never correct or interrupt him
That's disgusting
Don't play, I ain't a bit amused
Cause--
[Dizaster]
I'm an offshoot of Islam, that's why

[Soul Khan]
Nhhh, yeah that's debatable
But relatable
So
Well no I'm talking in your relation on what you do
You misrepresent yourself to your fans and to your opponents
I want them to take themselves back to the moments
And the raps that you told em
Using cultural standings that ain't actually holding
Are you of the mind that just because racist thinks all Arabs are in terror groups
That that makes it fair for you
To uphold the stereotypes of terror too?
What about Muslims who aren't Arab, dude?
You don't know think South Asians and African Muslims get hassled at customs?
Or that their women in hijabs and burkas are afraid of getting shot and murdered
Due to the rise in fucking Islamic, anti-Islamic fervor?
So he has a rebuttal
I'm sure that shit is subtle
You know a lot of the old Jewish lines I had were fucking foolish
But the difference between that and you is
I'm actually fucking Jewish
Like, this here, was his decision
And now we in this position
You hate the cultures vultures, what are you, a religion pigeon?
I mean obviously
You're Arab, so you know the language and the basic protocol
But you faking overall
I guess Dizaster is just Arabic for Rachel Dolezal
Either way, you lied so these people have no reason to even slightly believe you
Or
I have just freed you
To finally be you
Diz, do you hear this
Do you recognize the scheme
See where I'm trying to lead you
It's Soul Khan, from the last tribe of the Hebrews
Listen Diz, you can admit it
Honestly, you don't wanna do it out loud
And that's just too much to ask though
That's fine
If you're not Muslim, just stand here, looking like the world's stupidest asshole
Oh damnit, I'm so proud of you
That probably took a lot of you
Right?
Honestly
I don't wanna do anything more on this verse
But if this contest of a honor, pride and our worth
It's just a motherfucking homicide in the first
But, if that ain't enough
You just get to serve me
I don't give a fuck
Cause in 2021, your president is Bernie
(Diz: you done?)
I could be, hold on
I like you just wobbling back and forth
(Diz: c'mon pull something out, c'mon rebuttal something)
No, I don't want to right now
Just looking at you like, sorta like, wobbling, yeah go Diz, it's your turn

[Round 1: Dizaster]
Oh it's my turn?
Y'all ready for some shit?!
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?
Ay trust me, we gon get to the Muslim in round 3, but right now
Woo!
We gotta address fucking MC Dry Milk
This ain't a battle, this a race to see which one of us gon' be the first to get this guy killed
Me, or his white guilt
Fucking Soul Khan
I'm not the person to step to
Yeah, we gon' start off with this because honestly, I'm not here to psychologically test you
I'm here to open up a door, for everybody to get through
Just like a West Hollywood rest room
If I get mad today, I'mma just say ""F you""
Instead of wishing death on you, I'ma just wish I never met you
He wants to gender stuff, we can all be men, women too, c'mon
Even though y'all don't believe it, a lot of y'all like to pretend to
Just like your mom did to fulfill the role of your pops when he left you
Left you, without a dope beat to step to
Step one: this a battle, I ain't gotta respect you
Step two: you only here cause the rent's due
Your bitch left you
And the music not bringing the checks through
Step three: he couldn't make a return unless he
Went against me
The leader of the LGBT
Going against a WMD
He's a proud SJW
He's G-L-A-D to be the CEO of a bunch of new groups
A-B-C-D-E-F-G's
The H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P's
The Q-R-S, the T-U-V's, and don't you forget those X-Y-Z's
Are you fucking kidding me?
You said you quit battle rap, what you back here using us for?
You said you wouldn't return till you had a Grammy
You think we forgot the stupid shit you used to say and do from before
You said you was done with this game, you gon make go music and hit the booth and record
I guess it's safe to say he's back with the Canadians since America couldn't give this Jew no award (Juno Award)
Hold on, hold on
How long you gonna fucking hold on for?
It's been 9 years of you holdin' on
Recording songs
We thought you would blow up by now man, what's going on?
Why have you not got put on?
I thought you'd have some soul hits by now, but you don't
What a shocker, Khan (Chaka Khan)
I thought Brown Bag was growin' strong
But now you trying to weasel your way in with us and sneak back in and just roll along
And you want us to welcome you with open arms
Like I'm the vulture, pff, like we wouldn't notice you wrong
Right now, you walkin' in so many different directions, you like a child outside tryin' to find a Pokémon
And this is how all these silver spoon posers are
The moment they don't get what they want, that's the moment they gone
And I stayed here, puttin' in blood, sweat and tears, helping put this culture on
And that will always be the difference between your pros and your cons (Khans)
Khan you a fuckin' con artist
You know what rhymes with ""Soul Khan""?
(What?)
""This guy spends more time with Nancy Pelosi than he does with his own mom""
But now he's back, and he's focused on
Battle rap, he's back like he never left
Returnin' in the era of gun rhymes, pickin' the one guy that could give you punchlines and multis
Multiplied by hundred times of deaths, so follow the pattern
Cause you ain't getting the one liners yet
Fuck a gun rhyme
Bring your little anti-gun sign
Cause I ain't got a gun
I'm here to contaminate ya bloodline with a rusty knife instead
Puncture puncture, slice
Make your skull rupture like there was busted waterpipe of lead
Gushing by your head
Get your onion diced, I'll oven fry your egg
Cut and slice your chest
Open up ya eye with it
Leave it stuck inside your neck
And watch the whole other side go dead like the Butterfly Effect
They put a butter knife against a butterfly knife
This is the different between cookie cutter rhymes and someone who designs lines to be cutting edge
All you got is these lies you spread
You literally talk out the side of your neck
I'm really cut throat
So if you running ya mouth, you'll catch a Columbian necktie if I see a tongue comin' out
Watch out
You a bum now
I been on my Nate Dogg shit
Watched ya high come down
I became the professor of this campus
You dropped out as a Cub Scout
Since you returned as one of my students, well this could only one route
Oh you don't think I'm your teacher huh
Well you will when I blaow, have you spittin' your gums out
Phluh, now you have a yuck mouth (Yukmouth)
You see the signs when the Blood starts to come out
Speaking of cuttin', you cut ya legacy short
And you pressured to come back in the game cause you're stuck now
And we supposed to welcome you like this successful legend like...
What the fuck? How?
Cause he got 3,000,000 views versus QP? Fuck, wow
Since then, I left that in a dust cloud
While you spent the rest of your career like ""50 Cent trying to knock another SON down.""
Got so outta touch, he's like Al Bundy to us now
Which means ya battles with Madness, Fox, Deacon, QP would be your four famous touchdowns
Fuck outta here, you like the Gjonaj of Polk High
You wonder why he ain't come down to no actual battles?
He's too busy at the farmer's market tryin' to haggle over free salad samples
He went from being a savage asshole
To hangin' out with 6 foot women who wear Versace sandals and have Adam's Apples
And before we got the horrible, horrible, horrible news that you quit
You can admit, this dude who was sick
He just hasn't, you know, been the same dude ever since they surgically removed his dick
He had a surgeon open up two little slits and fuse a clit made out of a pair of two human lips
On to the passageway where he used to piss
And if you think this is bad, we're lucky he hasn't grew any tits
He's a fuckin' neutered Shih tzu with a uterus
Used to be a symbol of manhood like Mr. Bruce but all we got left is this confused little bitch
Oops, did I just say the ""b"" word?
You used to be as ruthless as it gets
Now you don't use the word ""bitch""?
Are you kidding me?
You bitch!
You're the biggest misogynist ever...and you still are
You don't get to change the rules as you wish
You might be able to fool these stupid little new liberal groups that you with
But the beautiful thing about the internet is that it's forever...and Google is quick
And YouTube is just two little clicks
{click click}
Exhibit A:
You once told a dude, ""You're useless as a chick without the coochie and the tits""
Listen, ""useless as a chick without the coochie and the tits""
Now I caught some slack for what I said to O'fficial
But I'll be honest, this some futuristic shit!
Now this same dude's a feminist? Man that's as stupid as it gets
Like you callin' people gay for all three of your rounds on all your old YouTube clips
And now your excuse for it
Is that you grew up since
And you weren't worried about whose kids you were going to influence
Or is it truly this?
That your new political views don't fit with the way that you used to spit
So you must've turned vegan too cause all of a sudden you super quick to come to a fruit's defense
God damn man, you too intense
You suffering from self delusion of how you view yourself
Staring back at the mirror like, ""Who is this?""
""Who am I?"" Who is this?""
I'll tell you who
You're the dude who called people ""homos"" and ""queers"" for most your career
So if you wanna act like we're the ones that are homophobic here
Ehhh that's sorta weird
Cause, I used to like you Soul Khan, at least back then you were more sincere
You once saw two dudes in the distance arguing about who says the word ""faggot"" more
And you told the dude that was standing next to you, ""Yo. Hold my beer.""
He's a fuckin' Fruit Ninja
The type that no one fears
When he throws a bomb, he throws a bomb
But when the smoke screen clears
He reappears with a picket sign and a pair of pink pointy ears
Like, ""I'm Soul Khan. Ready to fight this war
Standing on the frontline with my big homie Michael Moore.""
Soul Khan, been a Socialist for so long his hands and knees is sore
Had sunken cheekbones like a Swedish whore
He consumes Twitter feeds, he doesn't even eat no more
He's no longer the person he used to be before
Just to act as his own manhood he has to speak to it through a Ouija Board
I am literally raising Hell!
And after this you might as well change your name as well
I'ma make you hate yourself
When you leave here you gonna feel the same way you felt when you watch the new Dave Chappelle
Face it, you just outdated
You basic and stale, tryin' to break away from the shell
Your music sucks, no one gives a fuck if you sell
So tonight, you gon' be like Sheriff Hopper
Cause you gon' have a tough time puttin' up with this L (El')
I'm an O.G
King Of The Dot knows there's no show if there's no me
I go O.D
I'm like Eleven from Stranger Things
Cause I can even channel my energy to reach the nose bleeds
Got me teleporting like a flesh absorbing demogorgon
The best in this sport, I'm forever Jordan
The game change, became way colder
Caught him slippin' in the Range Rover
Start [?] with the flamethrower
He wants to ban AK's then fuck it, the shotgun can hit you from way closer
Operation Roc-A-Wear with Jay Hova
I'll put your brain on your Dame's shoulders
Awe man, here we go again

{Diz puts on Groucho glasses and pulls out a folder and starts his Soul Khan impression}

He said, ""Brains on my Dame's shoulder""
Hold on, hold on
That's why guns are bad for you Diz'
And any true human will tell you that every firearm leads to a mass school shootin'
Listen, hold on, hold on
Before I leave any session you know I got a few more lines
Yeah, yeah, you will realize and do more time
That people like Twork are bad for the community
Cause they inspire my precious black youth to do more crime
So if you ever decide to use your tool
Fuck you, fuck you
B. Dot you cool
Fuck you!

[Round 2: Soul Khan]
When he was in my face, I think, it probably hit me
I was just thinking, wow, has he reconsidered my offer to kiss me?
Diz, you're my homie though
But hold it man
And I ain't trying to diss that flag you're wearin'
But I gotta say, it was kinda disorienting, for this dude who's my homie y'all
To talk about Pokemon when he literally looks like a fucking Pokeball
So, we got this
So, my friend, are you done?
If not, that's cool son
I mean, I was just gonna go make a food run
I get you some
I was gonna cop some jerky, want a Slurpee? Red or the blue one?
You ain't gotta choose, you want the blue one
How you think this gon' go, 2-1?
Lot of people think you gon get 3-0'd
I mean that'd be pretty sweet yo
I mean, cause this shit is something you need for your ego
Me though? I be known
For some other shit that you think that we share, but when you compare, we don't
So, who here knows the song 'Fahrenheit'?
See cause people can sing along with that
Telling me you never feel like you wanted that
Honestly Diz', you was showing your rectum
If you say you have as close a connection
As I do fans across the entire emotional spectrum
I mean you have laughter, and over-aggression
I'm there for them when they lonely and desperate
Or when they're hopeless, hopeful, or breathless
When someone shows them affection
I'm there for them whatever they're living through
Whether they're training or in their living room
That's a sense of fulfillment I wish I could give to you
But I can't
But dammit I fucking pity you
I'm not in a battle gonna try to outrap or outflow you
But on a track I will roast you
Because you adapt when the Pro Tools are tracking your vocals
Or at least that's what's born out of by some other examples we'll go through
So, namely
You gave your mom a beautiful Mother's Day freestyle
Right?
It was gorgeous
It was written down
That does not make this better what I'm about to say
My friend, you gave your mom a freestyle for Mother's Day
There had to be another way
I'm talking flowers and cards
Instead of powerful bars!
If I was your mom I had wish you were a runaway
And honestly when I started watching it
Get really intense body language
Gotta be anxious
Gotta inching forward like he was gonna pull the straps on her
Look like you were about to Math Hoffa ya damn momma
Now, for the record
If I you wanna watch this, I made a shortcut
Tinyurl.com/dizmom
Alright?
Please join with me if you watching at home or later on Youtube
Because I love my mother too
And I've got time
My friend, we gonna go through all this shit line by line
Actual quote Diz said to his mom
""you're my sword when I'm swordless""
Why in God's name did you record this?
Hold on though!
If you're swordless, then your hand or wherever you sheathe it
By definition is not where your sword is
Bear with me
If I gotta I break it down, you understand
Just switch the metaphor with the shit's that's intended for
You're saying
You're my mom and when I'm momless
Which, my mom would be appalled if
She thought I thought that she wanted such incompetent dog shits
The next line is you're my spiritual fountain
Spiritual fountain!
I wanna hear all about them
My friend is a spiritual fountain more like a lyrical fountain or a miracle fountain
Spiritual fountain
The last line of this, blew my mind with this
You're my breath when I'm drowning
Now
When you drown, you lose air
So based on the sequence of the line
And the meaning that's implied
She is not keeping you alive, she is leaving you to die
But honestly, she seems really kind, no disrespect intended to your mom
Especially, cause all the shit Diz has said, and done
It's amazing Diz isn't done
So
Can we clap it up for Dizaster's mom
Now, the next example is a song that's actually your best
If that were case for me, I would be massively impressed
It's called 'Don't Play Me' produced by Chase Moore
That means the best aspect of a track ain't yours
Literally said, I'mma say this real slow for everyone to see
This was written down too, right?
It is? oh c'mon
""I'll strike you with a Midas touch and grab your wife and fuck
Till the hymen bust open like a fire hydrant wide and fire trucks driving sideways on the highways till I fuck my tires up""
I guess in that fires are chaotic and fuck everything up
But like, now, because I am a masochist and I've got time
We gon' tackle this line by line
Hold on
By the way, tinyurl.com/dontplaydiz
Oh I forgot, hold on wait a second, you know what rhymes with tinyurl.com/dizmom
Diz lied about his bond with Islam
Okay, so look
Back to this this Magnum Opus
So, ""I'll strike you with a Midas touch and grab your wife and fuck""
So the touch of Midas turn whatever you hold into genuine gold
Like it's treasure in a vault
So what you saying is
If someone gave you this incredible ability
You would use it to commit sexual assault
You are a great ambassador for this culture by the way
Let's go to this, ""till the hymen bust open like a fire hydrant wide and fire trucks""
Jesus Christ
I guess you're not aware that hymens don't bust, actually kinda tear
Even then it's a misconception that's kinda rare
Diz, do you know what a hymen looks like
Hold on, do you know what a vagina looks like
I see the gears turning
I hear them ears burning
He wants to rebuttal me
Like, ""of course I've seen a vagina, it's standing right in front of me
Auhh
I'm in Oakland
Now I'm standing over here in Oakland""
Next line
This the wild shit
""like a fire hydrant wide and fire trucks driving sideways on the highways till I fuck my tires up""
Are you the fire truck?
Like a Transformer?
Are you stunt driving like the Transporter
Are you like some fireman deplorably ignoring his last order
I don't get it Diz, the problem is also here is that the wife would also end up gold
Right?
Story there, somewhat
I can't tell if you're trying to cuckold or fuck gold
And I don't know if this is a minus or plus
But if she's making of gold, the hymen won't bust
And you know, gold, [?], that's strong material
You know what's not strong material?
Ya song material
And that's ya best song, goddammit, it's frustrating
I want to set up a rap camp
And we'll see you this summer
Ness can teach you flow
Mac can teach you structure
Maybe I don't know, I don't know people are new, Geechi Gotti would be an instructor
To help you not sound like such a geeky motherfucker
But I don't sound that weird
Diz, those beautiful braids
When I said you oughta to explore your artistry more
I didn't mean you should cosplay as the guitarist from Korn
This is you every time you perform
""to me, you're nothing but a future corpse
If this fragile little Jewish dork
Even imagines using force
I will Luchadore slam his little form
And use him as a tuning fork
No one gives a fuck about the stupid music you perform
I will build you a casket, fill it with padding
Just for keeping the acoustics warm
I'm hotter than the Human Torch
Which is actually funny, cause if you were born back in the 20s
In your grandparents' country, you would be a human torched
You are only the goat
Because all Jews were born
With a pair of hooves and horns""
You want us to think you're destined to kill a man
Nah, you look like you stuck between steps in the Thriller dance
And you still advance
If I had to change ya name to encapsulate the raid of trash you aggregate it would be Edward Fillerhands
What was that advice that Patrick had told you?
Relax, let em go loose
But yet, every time you use your arms, I'm imagining Goku at the supermarket examining produce
Diz
You always down for unlimited rounds like you Solid Snake
Here's something you should consider now, consolidate
I'm here to Marie Kondo out your closet space
You have always lived in, but never exist in, an Islamic State
You are getting so fucked up that it could become someone's fetish
Complete with its own subreddit
I hope that one of my old fans came to Oakland and grew up to become medics
Cause this level of blood shedding is upsetting
Like a pump of unleaded
Fuck buttin' heads, I am getting ready to behead him
Khan's flow, A.C. Cowlings with the Bronco
Kicking over lawn gnomes
You be dropping N bombs and you ain't got the launch codes
Oakland, California, can you hit me with the amen
Ay man, sicker than a vape pen
Diz be always whining like an infant in his playpen
Begging for respect that he's never gonna get, like Ricky and his grade 10
For me...nothing you'll ever say is gonna hurt me
Cause in 2021, son, the president is Bernie

[Round 2: Dizaster]
Wow, thank God
Y'all ready for rapping again?!
Now, when Soul Khan around anyone from the SONS, even the lesser ones
It's like he can smell it in the air
Earlier today he met Brixx Belvedere and he was like, ""Hmmm. I feel like I know you from somewhere.""
And Brixx was like, ""Ummm. I don't really-""
He's like, ""Yeah. I feel like I do. I feel like I know you from somewhere before.""
And Brixx was like, ""Okay, okay man. I'm not with the SONS anymore.""
""Ah ha! I caught you. Now feel the wrath as the lightening strikes down
If Conceited don't wanna battle me, fuck it Brixx I'll battle your right now!""
Bernie, Bernie, Bernie
This fuckin' pacifist, passive aggressive attitude obviously isn't workin'
Cause bro all you do is judge people and talk about politics
And if you think that's okay that's obviously a problem you need to solve first then
Cause it's probably no worse than
Somebody who spends all of his time absorbing other people's opinions online
To the point they actually forget to be their own person
He introduces himself as, ""Hi I'm a Socialist.""
Why don't you say, ""I'm Noah"" first then, help us help you discover your core version?
Cause even though you lost as fuck, I don't gotta be up here with you soul searchin'
I can't even find you, there's no person
You used to be merciless, no mercy, then went cold turkey, no cursin'
Even ripped up the old verses where he wrote cursive
Fell flat on his back then returned to the old circuit
Lookin' so nervous, feelin' more worthless
Shaking below surface
It's unfortunate when you decide to put the word ""Soul"" in your name and find out you ain't got a soul or a sole (soul) purpose
It's over
It's not even at the end of the show and it's closed curtains
I'ma put him in a bag and zip him up
Cause I'm focused now, so if one of these little guys in the crowd try to interrupt
I don't give a fuck
Listen, I came here to rip you up
If this is your hero then I must really be a heel cause I'm only a couple inches away from having Soul (sole) lifted up
You a baby Chihuahua bitch boy
Which means, you bark like you big and tough
But you really just a little pup
And you ain't ready for the final level of Contra bitch, your heart's not big enough
Yeah, he wants to protest against the guns
""Bernie""
But go ahead I don't need one
Long blade split down the middle but the edge is rough
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin'
I'll slice under the belly and give him a little nip and tuck
I'll create a new move called ""The Sitting Duck""
I'll vertically swing it up
And knock the lash off his eyeball before he can even blink it once
You think I give a fuck?
You think I give a fuck if the crew's filming us?
Yeah, put this on film and just
Rearrange your facial features on camera and twist ya little pixels up
I'll completely ruin your definition and get to slicing and get to edit stuff
And finish up with {slicing sound}
I call that, ""The Director's Cut""
And guess what
(What?)
It still isn't enough!
I gotta send it back to the Blacksmith so he can sharpen the ridges and add the finishing touch
BING
Now it's welded smooth and it's extra new
I call it, ""The Confession Booth"" cause it'll make you spill your guts
You fuckin' little bitch
I.E.D. in the building
Underneath your feet I'll blow this whole building up
You wouldn't survive the blast if you rolled up here with the same armor on as Gizmoduck
Bitch, all you got is the 1/2, 1/2 simple punch
Recycled puns, played out ones
Same typical order
Cliché fat joke
Cliché race joke
And he doesn't even think of the jokes, he's an Internet quoter
This is literally the Billy Crystal of Windows Explorer
But you're more of a nerd with a mental disorder
Which makes you Joaquin Phoenix cause you not even the original Joker
Bitch, you know what you are?
Ha, he said he makes music, you a shitty performer
You a little fuckin' leftist libby little sissy New Yorker
You a dime a dozen hipster
Making his songs with his little rhythms on his mini recorder
Then transfers them into his home studio through his mini controller
You think I give a fuck about being a political soldier or a registered voter?
You right bitch I'm [?] from the mountains of the [?]
Yeah, and I'ma go out smokin' in the middle of a forest gettin' lit like Christopher Dorner
You talkin' to someone who's really been in a war
I have crossed the Syrian border
Versus someone who speaks on our shit like a distant reporter
Like, ""Oh no. Those kids got hit by a mortar...
Well vote for Bernie and he'll pass that executive order.""
Fuck Bernie Sanders!
You a fuckin' hypocrite
Fresco-
Actually I like Bernie
But the point is, you a hypocrite
You- this is someone who literally told Fresco he was gay cause he was into yoga
Then nine years later he goes on Queenzflip and tells him that he's into yoga
I don't know if it's me or him or he's trying to undo every line he's ever said
You went from accusing people of being homosexual for slightly wearing their pants tight around their legs
To letting a grown man help you put your own legs behind your head
Yeah man, you're some type of tough rapper
All that learning how to do Pilates and shit, there can only be one answer
He's trying to learn how to become more flexible
So the next time he becomes depressed over Trump, he can curl up in a ball that much faster
""Fuck Trump!""
""Fuck Dizaster!""
He's an activist for the poor
Democrat pamphlets on the board
So I showed up to his house cause I was curious, what was all this activism for
Soon as I got to his front steps I was greeted by two buff ass tomboys with their arms crossed standing at the door
They said, ""What's the password?""
I said, ""Faggot""
One of them raised their hands like this and said, ""You now have access to the floor.""
I said, ""Thanks, but I'm not going in.""
""Well why not?""
I said, ""Cause this is kinda, sorta, really not my thing.""
""Wait a minute. Are you a homophobe?""
""Homoph- Nah, I love gay people.""
That's when the other one said, ""That's it! I've had enough of your shit man! You need to leave bro.""
And that's when I said, ""Bro?...You just assumed my gender!""
""Well yeah. You're totally a bro man.""
I was like, ""What?! I'm not a woman. I'm not in-between and I'm not a man.""
""Well what are you then?""
I said, ""I'm a- a- I IDENTIFY AS A PLANT!
I said a plant!""
""But bro you can't!""
I said, ""Wait a minute. Are you a plant-aphobe?""
""Plant-aphobe? Aw, aw nah. We're totally not plantaphobes, we love plants.""
I said, ""Well then you will address me as that
Do you understand?
""Actually. I do understand
Like, like how you're going through self expression
Like a vegan going through depression. I totally can dig it man
I mean Plant! I mean Plant! Fuck I mean Plant. Sorry.""
That's what it's like dealing with you idiots
I mean PLANT!
God fuckin' damn
Goddamn I forgot the part
I gotta freestyle now
You not a real Jew
I didn't have no Jew bars until now
You don't rock a Fedora
Wait, you not a real Jew you rock a Fedora
You not a real Jew you don't follow the Torah
You got LED lightbulbs in your home you don't got no Menorah
You not from Jerusalem, you from eastside Sodom and Gomorrah
And over there you control the set
Speaking of Gomorrah (Gamora), I'm Marveled at how your personalities both connect
When I walk you off close to the ledge and watch you drop onto the rocks over the edge
What you don't get it?
I'ma have Soul Stone'd to death
Bitch, we been on our grizzly while you overslept
A fuckin' California bear who's been in the New York Zoo for so long he became a domesticated home owner's pet
That shit you was cryin' on blogs you was supposed to get?
I stayed here and got those enormous checks
Cause I kept on workin', wakin' up in cold sweats
Workin' on these words, learnin' how to make more metaphors connect
While you got a legacy that's a Rolodex of homophobic insults to the most effect
You spit shit that your political views don't reflect
But you've grown up since
You've changed now, you're not a sexist, you quit it
Like you would let a racist white guy tell you, ""You know what? I'm no longer racist and you gon' let me get away with it.""
You a fuckin' hypocrite, contradict yourself in every statement you make
You just too fake to admit it
Cause you're really a closet fuckin' racist and that's why you got so many regrets
And the difference between me and you is I had a clean conscious when I said it
You understand me?
This guy got nothin' but basic linguistics, he's way too simplistic
He gave up and quit
Jeffrey Epstein, it's clear he was never able to hang to begin with
Aw shit, this shit is painful
He gon' get a face full of stitches
Paid In Full shit
Yeah, I'ma get creative with this
You think I hate you cause of your race?
Y'all are the chosen ones, man
An old generation that's bathing in riches
I'm just mad at you cause you're the only Jew that hasn't created a business
How scary is this?
My race angles are very vicious
I can put an end to a conversation with a Jew with two words; ""Merry Christmas""

[Round 3: Soul Khan]
I fear like there's gotta be an explanation of the actual definition of hypocrisy
So, a hypocrite is someone who says one thing and does different shit
Whereas I changed my entire life so your criticism doesn't apply
And here's another thing that you should regard quick
I didn't flop like I said, I quit music for a while
You're a terribly listener, no wonder your music is garbage
You think I'm a bigger geek than you
My friend, you're an anime obsessed fucking weeaboo
I heard that got married, congratulations
Do you call her your waifu?
Like the awkwardest white dude
Did you propose to her with cherry blossoms and haiku's
If it weren't for the fact that she probably wipes you
I'd say, she probably feels like she got a 9th grader
When she asks you to clean the bathroom, and you're like, ""you mean the Hyperbolic Time Chamber?""
What about the sex?
Is it hotter when you roleplay
As Inuyasha and Kagome
Now, do you think Diz is ever domestically violent?
Heck no
I'd say he never try it
And every time him and his wife get into a fight, she finds a way to let go
While you go in your basement and write her name in the Death Note
Diz talks about the streets, he isn't from there
He's from our neighborhood, where the hot topic is that Hot Topic was replaced by Pacific Sunwear
And the fact that you share a zip code with [?] just goes to show
You ain't naturally large, you just actually scarred
And have low impulse control
Are you okay man? you're doing okay, you'll get through with it
And that's why your parents are afraid you'll share the fate of Sharon Tate
So every black friend of Dizaster is a professional actor that his parents paid to scare him straight
It's not working I think
I have a question
They probably bail you out of all sorts of stupid shit that you do
So
It is, I'mma have to ask you, are you actually cool with?
The fact that you supported Trump and therefore backed a political movement that doesn't actually consider black people a human?
You okay man? you look so upset
So I'll say this
Leupold good snooze, he's falling asleep, falling asleep, okay cool
I heard your guns are lethal, popping with them tools
Correction, all your guns are legal, officer approved
'cause ain't nothing more gangster than following the rules
Something that I noticed, when you first [?] around, you didn't spit gun bars a lot when you came into the circuit
How was it?
Crafting them, waiting till they were perfect
Did you wanna hone them even more, wait till you deserved it
I got it now, you ain't spit gun bars cause you were waiting for a permit
Very responsible of you
You always like to say that Americans have rights
Correction, America always has Arabs in its sights
America has rights, no America has kids in cages terrorized by ICE
I'm telling you and asking you, man to man
Go talk about American rights to the tombstone of Sandra Bland
You're a new husband, some day a prospective father
Talk about American rights to the grandkids and kids of Eric Garner
Diz, I agree that in many ways, Clinton would've been a evil killer
But the communities I work with, are truly getting hurt Diz
And a lot of it is because that motherfucker Stephen Miller
Who is it?
Oh golly shit man, Stephen Miller, the opponent by the guy you voted for
And I know you changed your mind, but you can't change your time
It's kinda weird right now, it fucks me up a little bit
I know this ain't your typical wordplay, work day
But it's a little disturbing you ain't know who Stephen Miller is, but you probably know like Piccolo's birthday
See, I have changed, Diz
It's proof, you don't agree cause you don't believe in evolution
No, like you don't actually believe in evolution
Like the theory of Charles Darwin
The theory of evolution
You don't believe in evolution, it's the reason that we're human
But I do remember you have a thing for Schrödinger's cat
Well the man Schrödinger that, conceived it and concluded it that even he fucking believed in evolution
You know what rhymes with Schrödinger too?
He was inspired by Einstein, socialist Jew
Diz, what you gonna do if battle rap vanishes
Alright, what you gonna do
Where would you shift in your life
I mean Real Deal is a educator
Ooops was a legislator
Fuck, what are you?

{Dizaster whispers: ""a detonator""}

A son of privilege riding on a golden escalator with the social skills of a 2nd grader?
My man, you need to find something, to shift your life
I still got music, just started again, [?]
Let me give you some advice
Find a mission that might not pay a lot but make you feel like you got skin in the fight
Hell, keep talkin' about Socialism, maybe you could join our organization DSA
Come with us on this journey
Cause in 2021, I know you [?] about this, the president is Bernie

[Round 3: Dizaster]
Alright man that was cool...Jesus Christ
I don't mean no offense by that by the way
See cracking jokes and laughing is fine
But let's get back to the stats and the actual signs
Your total impact on battle rap is 12,000,000 views you have racked up online
In comparison I have 13,000,000 on one battle so technically one match up of mine
Has more views on it than all your battles combined
Yeah, you have the battle in mind, but it's the cancerous kind
The type that thinks, ""Hmm. All these battlers are doin' is just passin' their time
But if they can't use this to boost their music then that can't get no shine.""
'Til someone shows him a picture of Tsu Surf and he takes off his glasses, ""Hmmm. I can't really see that. I'm actually blind.""
And this is how he was actin' when he was back in his prime
I want you guys to try to imagine what he would've acted like if he actually got signed
""I'm Soul Khan and all you MC's are peasants!""
Let that sink in for a second
And tell me this dude here is on my level
When he hasn't even shown y'all enough love or wrote enough history
And I still say this to little bro respectfully
A two year stretch is like Bill Bellemy, that's a joke of a legacy
So whether he, do or don't have any respect for me
In the end, I'm still considered the legend on every top ten you see
If you even say the word ""battle rap"" my resume alone will force you to mention me
I'm memorable because of my work ethic, of course they remember me
The respect we have for you is only present because we as a culture selfishly kept you alive in our collective memories
Because besides that you haven't done anything
You're prevalent cause we make your relevant and that's a closed case and a no brainer like JF Kennedy
I'll bet you a dead president half of these people forgot your name
But for our sake, for our sake

{Soul Khan starts laughing}

Oh don't laugh, cause yeah, it's okay
They probably forgot your name
But we still gotta give you a little star on battle rap's Walk Of Fame
Just not on Hollywood Boulevard, yours would be laid down on Memory Lane
And that's the realest shit anybody's ever wrote about you
Cause you wanna be this voice for the people but your body of work don't add up to what you socially amount to
I got my crown jewels cause I show and prove strictly off ground moves
While you got a status quo that exists merely cause the people around you
Subjectively gave it it's value
Don't you get it? Without us, you don't have you
And without me, they don't have views
So without this battle the fans lose
And if you ever question who I am to this scene, I'm everything bitch, THAT'S WHO!
And you the little jokey jokey kid, who only poses a risk (wrist) when he poses like this
Uh oh, I think he's forming a flip
He's about to channel the inner Charron from his dick
He makes jokes about himself cause that's his only defense
But what kind of lack of testosterone is this?
He's gon' become some kind of leftist Hollywood director
I can see it now, workin' on his own little script
Relaunching new episodes: Soul Khan Presents: Zena The Warrior Prince
This guy went from a full blown chauvinist to an emotional bitch
Look I understand that you regret being so homophobic but you need to get over it quick
Don't be like Jussie Smollett now and beat yourself up over this shit
Because of course you're not homophobic bro, we know that
Cause you're really gay in secret
Last time you passed out at a frat house they drew a dick on your forehead while you were sleepin'
And the first thing you said when you woke up and peeped it
Was...""I'ma keep it.""
So that's all you had? The little homophobic kiss me angle you was gonna come back with?

[Soul Khan] The offer still stands

[Dizaster]
To cover up the fact that you were consistently callin' people ""homo"" as one of your habits
You wanna know something bro? You know what's really gay?
When they asked you if you had love for battle rap still and you answered back with, ""I don't know if I've ever had it.""
Soul Khan in our world, that's the definition of a {beep}
Of course he gets no passes
If he recycles he should be judged like all the MC's
He said, ""Oh, I don't know if I can catch up on these battles to know if I'm reusing a bar or a scheme.""
But that's the point dummy, it's pretty much a logical thing
You wouldn't have to watch 1,000,000 battles in a row if you actively cared enough to still be a part of the scene
But, you wouldn't have to catch up if you were here
That's what makes you a foreigner but what does all of this mean?
It means you failed as a battle rapper and you failed to go mainstream
So now you this lost underground backpacker that's caught in-between
Wanting to make bars or do a song where you sing
So Soul Khan you'll always be a man of many Willy Wonka hats but you'll never be the boss of one thing
So tell me, what you planning to do with all this you self deprecating Jew apologist?
I know you're reformed now but to me you're every ""isist"" and ""ologist"" there probably is
You made a living off of calling people ""fruit balls""
You're basically a RuPaul-ogist
All these things make it all too obvious
Khan is a true Communist
But this is Americana, and what Khan insists on don't make no kinda sense
We on some reconnaissance
You know who my gang is Khan, don't make me Genghis Khan your shit
Death by a thousand cuts, I'll leave him with all kinds of body slits
When the Katina leaves cuts in him deep as the Mariana Trench
I'm fast as Mayweather, you may die now quick
Pull up on him, Maradona kick
I'll dangle you from a cedar tree like a pinata then bat you with a fuckin' hockey stick
And keep beatin' your body with it until the candy (w)rapper that's inside of you eventually falls out of it
I fucking {beep beep beep} take a fuckin' time bomb and shove it down your esophagus
Have you coughing up blobs of phosphorus
Since you're a narcissist you shouldn't have a problem when someone makes you swallow your own confidence
I'll curb stomp this Erin Brockovitch lookin' nerd
Off of his high horse then drag him by force from his nerdy ass little work offices
I'll put him in a dirt plot, put the Earth on top of it
I could put him in a box or a bag but this what he gon' earn (urn) off of this
A fermented body in a reserved spot in a fully furbished German Sarcophagus
This is the most violent Socialist inside your metropolis
He wants to strike over politics
Ready to riot outside the White House in Washington
Getting into a dildo fight with Milo Yiannopoulos
He said if it wasn't for the music he might've destroyed all of us
Pssst, well let's look at the ergonomics and purpose of this worthless comment
Your verses has always been full of meaningless words
So no one gives a fuck about your new learning process
We never got to see the work in progress
I'm a murderous terminologist
A wordsmith and a workaholic
You a dirty Socialist that never earned shit but feel like you deserve a profit
Capital One, tell me what's in your wallet
You said you can't focus on battle rap cause music is your obligation
Well let's contemplate on Khan's template
Let's spend a moment in a world of Khan's creations
His ancestors used to get fucked up in Concentration Camps
But he stays with a camp that fucks up his concentration
If you ask me, I think Khan is in his own constellation
His concept is so convoluted and drawn far outta context
That for me it's confirmation, if they ever held a nomination, who had the best content
That Khan verse (converse) wouldn't even be in the conversation
Who does name flips like that?
How many concerts has Khan conducted?
How many projects has he conjured up or Khan constructed?
I'll tell y'all...nothing!
So of course he gonna talk about my accomplishments
I fucked up a lot of times, those were the hands I was dealt
But you aspire to battle people like Aspire
So naturally you'll never understand how battling someone like Canibus or Cassidy felt
Because you packed up and left, only to return like Kim Kardashian and make an ass out yourself
Cause what you say? ""I'm done. There's no battlers left.""
But a real battle rapper doesn't beg for no hand outs or never asks for no help
I'm the man because I became a man that can stand by himself
And you here cause you battling Dizaster, that's it, you don't have nothing else
I'm on a different level, I single handedly branded myself
I shouldn't even have to meddle (metal) with these little pussies like a chastity belt
I'm glad I came down to Oakland to give him this ass whippin'
He just panders to the crowd, acts like he cares about black culture
He just usin' black culture to push him, he drops one line about civil rights and the whole crowd overlooks him
But if you really believe the whites were gentrifying your city you would've moved yourself the fuck outta Brooklyn
You are literally an invader on a black man's turf
And you're Jewish which makes it that much worse
Literally, you're the problem you're trying to take out
And it's the same way back in the day, the GrindTime situation played out
You say, ""R.I.P. PH"", but when he alive you did him like a two faced snake
Lucky for you back then the little dirt never came out
But I got the info and then some
How he was helping you get some battles back when you couldn't even get your shit done
He was giving you views, helping you build them back up when you couldn't get none
He even gave you Cortez, that was your biggest name back then
He matched you against him
And then as soon as the opportunity to battle on URL comes
You left him hanging on his next event, you bailed out and you ditched him
A straight sucker from the Maze Runner, I wanna see you climb your way outta this one
Man, ain't no safe house or escape routes, I'm pulling out the big guns, the big ones
The type to make Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff run
AK's with the twin drums
I call 'em ""Soul Crushers"" [?] scope on top
Your dome gettin' popped
I put Soul in a box like Ghostbusters
Y'all remember Ghostbusters?
Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, when they trapped Slimmer in that little box in the beginnin'?
He's like, ""No. I prefer the Ghostbusters version where they casted the women.""
Of course Soul Khan
And I like women, I love women a lot
But what type of women are you talking about?
The ones that take photos for King Of The Dot?
Whoa, it looks like we're going straight to the source
Oh well, I guess Soul Khan is only here now because he's going through a really rough divorce
And it's funny because, he come in here like he has this master plan
Oh, but y'all don't understand this fam'
That no matter how you slice it, we lookin' at a queenless person, this is half a man
He's a- half of the king he used to be, he has half of his throne
Half of his belongings and only half of what he owns
So you can talk about my marriage, I'm happily married, I don't have a problem letting that shit be known
I'd rather be that than this fuckin' depressed little fuckin' bachelor that doesn't have a home
Behind this fuckin' feminist curtain there's a man that's sad and alone
He wanted to make all the women in the world happy but he couldn't even make his own woman happy at home
And she gone now
Ain't no tellin' what ya ex-bitch might do
He said he wants to be a black man for the activist
He just mad his white ass found out his wife does too
But hold on to hope Soul Khan your dreams might come true
If she really your Soul mate
Then wait nine years and maybe she'll make a comeback just like you
And he thought I was gonna have 6,000,000 Jew jokes like I was gonna talk about Hitler
When he's wasted ten years of his life with a photographer chick and he still doesn't get the picture
Or maybe he does, and the rest is just numb
Cause the relationship dipped into a dark room and eventually developed into a negative one
Rumor is, after you got married, you stopped battling cause she didn't let you
Which is ironic cause your timing of coming back is soon as she left you
You need to face the music, she left you naked and made you look stupid
But hey, in a way she was perfect for you cause she ended up walking away from the ring the same way that you did
That shit is oh so cold
She walked in and she told you go
I don't know man, it sounds like she signed a record deal or something cause that chick really sold her Soul
Maybe it's because you're always going on about Trump
Trump this, Trump that
Trump he did this
Republican that
Government that, government this
Always up in somebody's mix
To the point he left no attention to the special someone he's with
What part of this doesn't he get?
Your wife left you because of this shit
Probably had enough of you running your lip
Then she's probably out there right now aggressively suckin' some Republican's dick
And that's just the hypothetical, here's where we cause the most damage
I'm really sorry about this ammo cause this shit gon' get volcanic
Cause it's ahh kinda ahh, I kinda heard before she wanted to be with you she wanted to be with Organik
Oh man, and that's the bro Travis
When he asked you for this battle, he was like, ""Bro have it.""
Same way he answered you when you asked about her
He was like, ""Bro have it.""
Oh man, oh fuckin' dammit
I don't even like getting this personal, these are your tactics
You the one that brought up QP's baby mama
His son, his child support and his taxes
You the fuckin' one that brought up Sandusky versus Rone cause you felt like it would be so savage
You the one that brought up Real Deal's son in not one, but multiple matches
So spare me this victim bullshit, cause your karma here is solely from the role that you practice
Now onto our parents
You know how mad I get when people talk about my parents
Oh man
Oh man
Now, what about our parents bro?
Huh? What about our parents?
My mom....is a math teacher
And your mom is a librarian

[Soul Khan] Clerk

[Dizaster]
Librarian clerk
But why are we comparing them?
Because women teachers? They queens, they deserve all the praise
Minimum wage they deserve all the raise
They the most underappreciated in a way
Then comes your mom
Sitting behind a desk, stamping books, twiddling her thumbs all day
A library clerk, that's why her son came out into books like a nerd
That's where the mother/son similarities occur
Cause my mother is a math teacher...and I came out to be a Math teacher just like her
Now hold on
Let me talk about my dad since everybody wants to talk about him
My father's dad passed away when my dad was only 19
Alright? His name was Bachir just like me
He had three younger brothers, and a little sister
So now forced to raise them on his own, he had no chance but to look for a bigger picture
In 1976, my pops saved up and bought his first car
Had it on top of the hill, just parked on it, and that's when the civil war got started
A dude named Michel Aoun and the Christian Armed Forces dropped a bomb on it
Now when I say ""Christian"", y'all assume that I'm Muslim, right?
But I'm Druze, I'm not Muslim
But I loved them, they my brothers
But back then, we was in a holy land grab over religion
A world driven by sectarianism
You wouldn't the meaning of a fucked up system
The people where I'm from will die to live where you live in
To eat the food that you eat to sip the water you drink
And that's the reason you saw me protesting
But since you a spoiled little American brat
I'ma explain America to you through my eyes to teach you this lesson
Now let's go back to the 70's where I left you in that last scene
Where Michel Aoun blew up my father's car in front of our house in Baakleen
Now this is where he knew he had to leave if he was to expand the family tree
But life there was lookin' hopeless
So the only place that could've gave us this life was the Land Of The Free
This is why I love America
Because my dad came here to build a path just for me
And after that, he went bankrupt and we moved permanently
Those next eight years would make me everything that I am
In the street, playing soccer, bare feet, kickin' the can
In the fuckin' mud 'til the sun came down, shit that really turned a kid to a man
But that was when you were in Woodland Hills with this little Gameboy in ya hand
So you wouldn't really understand would you?
Yeah, cause all we had was to be able to go out and play
But as Lebanese kids we were taught to be appreciative that in a way
Even though all we had was cold showers most of the time and four hours of electricity during the day
I lived through this shit
And through the rest of my settlement, my country would be going through this development
Now listen, you remember how I said the dude that blew up my dad's car in the first segment?
Okay, this is why the whole thing is relevant
This is the reason I said the shit
Cause that same person, 30 years later has now been elected as our president
We're talking about somebody who's a political war criminal who executed thousands by his hand
He's killed everything I love and that's the reason I wave this flag
You hate the president of America because I understand
His policies make you mad
He's a goof, I know, the Tweets make you sad
But guess what
I hate my president because he fuckin' broke up half my nation and damn near took away my dad
And listen, this is real shit
They wanna start a holy war with Muslims, Druze and Christians
But I will never go back to the ways that are old tradition
I would rather go over there and die with them then fight with them
Those are my brothers those are my sisters
I look at them like they my children
Now listen, I understand there's inequality here towards blacks in this system
That has nothing to do with him
I don't care how he sees the views if they've never been used against him
So for what it's worth, you right, I'm not Muslim
I am Druze, alright?
Do you know what that means?
That means we are under Walid Jumblatt, we are Socialist by birth
That means, I can tell you firsthand that we're supposed to be the most peaceful people on Earth
I mean, we're supposed to be peaceful at birth
But if you push us we can be some of the most fuckin' violent people on Earth
And the point being, is that you're a fuckin' wanna-be Socialist
You don't know what you're screwing with
Socialism is in my fucking bloodline and I want nothing to do with it
Because I know first hand bro
Trust me, I've lived under this Socialist government shit
I'll tell you first hand that nothing gets fixed
The garbage doesn't even get picked up, no one gives a fuck about shit
But you wouldn't understand because you an inexperienced, uncultured son of a bitch
This ain't about the joke you living or the votes you gettin' in the real world people carry guns then die over Socialism
You want us to live in this global prison
Where we take orders from these fuckin' old tradition senior citizens
That are four times older than him
So the main point, you ain't never been through nothing like this
And go back to what we were saying on our parents
Alright? This is what it means to be a Lebanese-American
It's the journey it's where we came from and where our parents been
So since you think you gon' talk about my parents I'ma use my own parents to embarrass him
Back to when we was talkin' about your mom being a librarian
But let's go to your dad now
You heard my dad's story, oh you ready
You heard my pop's story, his struggle was hard
He came here and turned an emotional scar and made himself to a star
And I'm following in his footsteps
Which proves your pops is always a reflection of who you are
But what about your dad?

[Soul Khan] He was a piece of shit

[Dizaster]
Well he was a lawyer, and that could be respected
But then what happened? He lost his bar
And became an unemployed fucking loser taking business calls from his car
Wait a minute, that's not all
He was a musician like you, he wanted to top the charts
He thought it'd go far
Hibbity har har har
And just like you, I doubt you'll make a career out of this ever
Since you're admitting he's a shitty role model, then let me spend the rest of this to teach you how to do better
Your pops at 19 got a deal with Capitol Records
Compared to what happened to my dad at 19 that's substantially better
Like way better
But then what happened?
He got dropped before he could put out any records
And he was being managed by Phil Spector!
Like- that's The Beatles manager, like how fuckin' bad can you be
Like this is where your fuckin' personalities connect accurately
Because you both went to New York to become the man you could be
I guess it's true what they say, the Big Apple doesn't fall far from the family tree
Aw man, everything about you is what makes you such a lame ass loser
I'm too advanced
This like a cave man with his tools to a space man with a computer
A space man with a computer-
Wait a minute
Fuck it, you wanna know what the fuckin' joke was about?
So who guessed the riddle I was putting out?
Lucy, a drug dealer with a hangover
Coco, you plus me equals...human
Cousins, Caesar
What are these names of?
Evolution, primates
So to clear up the confusion
This about to be rebuttaled to everything he just said about the evolution
Now, first of all, on the evolutionary chart
Our most common oldest ancestor on Earth would be Lucy
Now Lucy, is our oldest ancestor
Technically, like a human fused with an animal
By battle rap standards, that would be the beginning for us; Juice vs. Supernatural
Now most of our class, evolved from that
Those are the ancestors that both connect us
And then there's you on the evolutionary chart
Outta nowhere with the gay jokes
You would be...you would be homoerectus
Now the anatomy of homoerectus...anatomy wise they were flat and small
They were loud, they had tiny hands, they were small
They had no balls and that was all
They thrived during the GrindTime Era, pay attention
This is gonna get crazy
They thrived during the GrindTime Era
Along with the emergence of a new group of hominids
Those were called the Neanderthals
The GrindTime white guys
Predominantly white, they felt like they had it all
They came into the game as giants which allowed them to stand up tall
But eventually their lack of culture will allow them to succumb to a massive fall
Which predicated the rise of the Cro Magnon man
We're movin' along the chart
The Cro Magnon man, in our standards that would be the URL rapper, the Chrome Magnum Man
Now ironically enough, this the first man to use the tools
And everything was cool
But eventually they couldn't come up with anything new
And they hit the ceiling limit of their genetic pool
Then comes the final transformation into today's modern homosapiens
Me
Lux, Mook, Pat, Illmac, The Saurus, ICE, Goodz, Shine
People that been here for generations
And most of them branched way out through these changes
Including me, I went through every single one of these evolutionary changes
Hold wait, that's why I got it down to a mathematic perfection
Cause now I'm giving you a timeline which is an accurate projection of where we had this connection
And where we last left off at the last intersection
Cause you had no battles left, so it threw a monkey wrench in what was then your rapid progression
Which then lead you to get wiped out by natural selection
Do I know about evolution? Maybe
Now, this is where you learn something new here
Cause evolution ain't the only thing that I can do
We almost done, I need you to focus with me we're waaay past half way here, we're almost at the end
We at the end, we way past half way here
I'm gonna need some crowd participation, are you guys awake here?
{Crowd cheers}
Alright, pull out your phones right now
And trust me, I got all day, I could stay here
Google ""Infinite Monkey""
Tell me what that say here

[Guy in the crowd]
""A monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for infinite about of time will surely complete works of William Shakespeare

[Dizaster]
William Shakespeare
Ooh, that's another picture I put out, the sixth clue
They say if a infinite amount of monkeys type on an infinite amount of typewriters in an infinite amount of universes
They should be able to replicate the work of Shakespeare
But later on this theory would disprove itself
And actually say that, for that to be possible the probability of it is the closest number to zero
And this is why me and  you will never be equal
This is what separates us from monkeys as people
Because you see, even if you took a million, trillion infinite Soul Khans in a trillion trillion universes
You will never be able to truly replicate the truest purpose of this human's verses
And that's why I made this
To let you know that you could never reach me
I became an advanced being in this and you will always be that fuckin' monkey underneath me

[Verso 1]
Ahora que ya mi vida se encuentra normal
Que tengo en casa quien sueña con verme llegar
Ahora puedo decir que me encuentro de pie
Ahora que me va muy bien
Ahora que con el tiempo logré superar
Aquel amor que por poco me llega a matar, no
Ahora ya no hay más dolor
Ahora al fin vuelvo a ser yo

[Coro]
Pero me acuerdo de ti
Y otra vez pierdo la calma
Pero me acuerdo de ti
Y se me desgarra el alma
Pero me acuerdo de ti
Y se borra mi sonrisa
Pero me acuerdo de ti
Y mi mundo se hace trizas

Ahora que mi futuro comienza a brillar
Ahora que me han devuelto la seguridad
Ahora ya no hay más dolor
Ahora al fin vuelvo a ser yo

And it's this land I rule without competition, see
Nothing is gained if you never take risks
I plan to progress till we don't exist

Seen you cross the runaway
Off that boeing jet
For my dreams know I overslept
Play our love songs back like an old cassette

And I just heard it on the radio
Know they recording what we say
Like 1984
Tryna take control
Of how we think and shape our souls
Still if this life is all we get then Ima make the most

Man I was in too deep
Just tryna stay afloat
Money coming off keys
Had to change the note
Got that drip like rain coat
Cigs I chain smoke
No I ain't rich yet but the kid won’t stay broke

You can’t achieve what you can’t imagine
My psyche damaged
But my soul еxpansive
Take advantage what thеy take for granted
That’s why I’m dream chasing
Whipping thru Topanga canyon
They call me Major Tom like David Bowie
Microdosing others doing ceremony
Cover up my scars with the name brands

And seen em point at you
Make you think about
The ones that you important to
Let go of my ego
Tryna change my point of view
Tell myself I’m sorry
That I disappointed you
Put my jacket on cutting through the morning dew
Still got that varsity red with hints of royal blue
-Treat your dream like its romance
Like I was sixteen learning how to slow dance
-Long way from the top but still
Looking down on the world
Cus you thought it was real
Kids swallowing pills do it all for the thrills
From the coast thru the valley to the Hollywood hills

I been living at the airport
Pushing away everyone
Who there for me
You showed me love in its rarest form
Make it hard for me to feel like you don’t care no more

I got nowhere
To hide

Way out on the dock that night the colour is red
23rd victim of a gangland war takes his last breath
Outside the sister cried she said the whole world's so mean
Heavyweight killer in the ring, turns killing machine

All my love, you're my all
They way you move, you're in control
The way you talk, the way you dress
Your hands, your touch, your sweet caress
All my love, you're the best
Every little thing that I possess
It's all emotion when you take control
I can feel wild horses running in my soul
Oh my love, all I see
The stars, the sun, the energy
If this going to kill us then let it go
Quit dreaming this is real life baby

This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
Oh, this is the one

But it might go wrong
This is the one
This is the one she's waited for

[Chorus]
And this is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one I've waited for

[Outro]
And this is the one
Oh, this is the one
Oh, this is the one
This is the one I've waited for
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one4Embed",rock
